		A1YAREUKQU7KLX	Tastes Great BUT check out the SUGAR content	Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix.  I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.  Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.<br /><br />:-)	2	1
		A3S4IWXSZCN9N7	The most awful taste	I purchased this because I read that it was a natural cure for hives..Um, how about NOT.  It did nothing for my hives and it tastes awful.  Luckily, a co-worker of mine loves this stuff (reminds him of his grandmother) and I gave it to him.  Yucky, yucky stuff.	1	3
		A3LWC833HQIG7J	Excellent chips, full of flavor and just the right thickness and doneness	I purchased the Salt and Vinegar chips and have been very pleased. There is the right amount of vinegar, virtually every single chip I have tasted is done just right, no burned chips, and they have an excellent thickness to impart just the correct amount of potato taste.<br /><br />They go great with lunches or as a snack. They are very economical. Beats the heck in terms of quality, taste, and price to buying these at work or out and about (I bought the 2 ounce bags). I will be trying some of the other intriguing flavors. Recommended.	0	0

		AF0JWSFEEOS0X	Fantastic Belgian chocolates!	My mom first tried Leonidas chocolates when a co-worker brought her a sample from Belgium years ago. Later, during a family trip to Amsterdam in 2001, we stopped at one of their shops and bought several pounds of this fantastic chocolate for ourselves and family members.  10 years later, I ordered these as a Christmas present to my mom, knowing how much she loves these chocolates, and Leonidas, still does not disappoint. These were a total hit for the holidays and my mother, who does not eat dark chocolate, even gobbled up all of the dark chocolate pralines included in the holiday ballotin, they're that good! They are totally worth the expense.	0	0

		A2LDT9BIN9ZBYR	Not very good!!!!	On the cover, pink guava and coconut sounds very interesting and tasty.<br /><br />It was the complete opposite.<br /><br />My taste is very good and i am not picky at all. I can eat most food on this planet without hesitation.<br /><br />But, the taste on this drink is different. It does not taste good or bad. It for sure doesn't taste like a $10 product.<br /><br />It taste like the container that holds the drink. The taste does not taste like guava or coconut water.	2	2
		A2IC971NTAR38Z	Good Jerky	Loved the flavor and soft and chewyness of this Beef jerky. Spicey and great to every peice.<br />Not a bad price for where other jerky is more than $23 for barely 1lb and this one is steal with it	2	1
		A2BCDZO1XQLDH	Excellent product	This fizzy fruity soda tastes great and has no added sugars (including all the hidden ones). Tastes great, but for those who think this is a lo-cal drink, nope: 135 cal per can. Has added Vitamin C (100% RDA). Like most fruit mixes main juice is apple/grape, but kiwi, acerola (a wild cherry fruit), strawberry, and raspberry are listed in the ingredients. I thought you could taste flavors beyond the apple/grape combo as well.	1	0
		A3JZNCC3VX1AAC	Lavazza Tierra! Espresso 100% Arabica Coffee Beans, 2.2 Pound Bag	Fantastic coffee beans. I made today 2 espresso shots with my Rocky and Andreja Premium at 10 and 9 bars of pressure. These were the best 2 espresso shots I've ever had. Far better than any Coffee house and better than other coffee beans including Illy with a fraction of Illy price. I'll definitely use again in the future.  Thanks Amazon, thanks Lavazza.	3	0
		AAA0TUKS5VBSA	People Food?	"As this cat food has the somewhat comical tagline ""People food for cats!,"" it may either at first appear charming or like a gimmick.  I think it is fair to say that it is a charming gimmick.  The foods are indeed fashioned after human food, but are more like food for baby humans than us adult humans that prefer strong seasoned flavors.  Of course, that is a good thing, as a healthy diet for a cat is quite different than for a human.  The ingredients, then, are basic, with nothing offensive like wheat-gluten.<br /><br />As for the taste, I agree with other reviewers that this comes down to the preference of each cat, but it has been a great hit with cats in my experience!"	1	0
		A1MTURFHSL92YI	Great choice of food, no stomach sensitivities	One of my cats is 17 years old and I rescued her from the outdoors.  She had a rough life before I had her.  Over the years I've fed her premium brands and a few regular brands.  I tried this food after I first saw the commercial and I've never had to switch to any other since.  I like this food because all 3 of my cats like it and they don't have any sensitivities to it.  The bottom line is that I'm certain there are many brands on the market that may have only natural ingredients in them.  But I think all food has to have some preservatives in them so they are able to be packaged for sale in dry form.  So how can even the purest foods with preservatives in them really be any better than this one?  I don't feel as though I'm shortening my cats' life span feeding them this brand.  Hey, 17 years and still kickin' is enough proof to me.  I give The Goodlife Recipe two thumbs up!!	2	1
		A2DSNJCYTQQDR5	Best coffee in the world	Nestle's Mountain Blend has the best flavor of all the coffees, both instant and regular, that I've ever tried, and the least acidic.	3	0
		A2QDBOHV00NOR2	Cat's love it	"I got this after reading an article in Natural Health magazine's October 2008 edition, ""Feed your pet Right"". The article identified protein rich, nutritionally balanced cat food.  My TWO cats did not like the chicken types, but LOVE the red snapper, tuna and shrimp, tuna and sole and yellow fin tuna.  I get the combo in the 4 pack.<br />I would recommend switching over from dry food to wet slowly so there's no upset stomachs.  I think your cats will like this food, even if they are picky, like mine."	1	0
		A2ALMIJP3PTEIT	FABULOUS POPCORN	We wouldn't use any other kind of popcorn.  It is actually BETTER than theater popcorn!  It has just the right amount of salt and butter.  DELICIOUS!	2	2
		A1UDF2QA5DKDFB	Best popcorn, best price by subscription	I ordered this initially just to try something less expensive than the whirly pop brands. I was really glad I did and I will continue to buy it. Everyone loves it and it is the perfect thing for the whirly pop popper. Buying it on subscription is the best way to go - decreases the price and eliminates shipping charges. This is a keeper.	1	0
		A1EUUMCY1DE1DF	Great Snack	Since losing weight my snacks have become far and few. With these I can have low calories and high protein. I love the taste.	0	0
		A2G7E5M928TVKE	ZiwiPeak is made in the US, consistency problems	Many people are buying this food believing it is safer because it is made in New Zealand. It is now made in the US by Performance Pet Products. I have been feeding this food to my cats since the recall horror of 2007 and prior to the change it was excellent food and I was thrilled with it. Since ZiwiPeak has been switched to canning in the US it has been a nightmare. Several times in the last year I have opened the food to find it is a green or blue colour. I had to return those cans because it made both my cats vomit and have loose stools. Also recently I have found large sharp bone pieces are present and very large strange chunks of greyish pink material that looks like connective tissue. I've contacted the US distributor twice but they have never replied. A batch I got this month with an expiry date of 2014 has caused severe vomiting and shedding with both cats who were previously healthy.	11	0
		A16LRBEMTPMRRA	Decaffinated Tulsi Tea Priced Way Too High	For Tulsi Original Decaffinated Tea the price is outragious for 1 box -- over $16.00!!!!! Rip off!!! What's the difference in cost for regular caffeinated and decaffinated to make the price too high. I don't get it.	0	5
		A2XHKPWCJHMWUN	Great value for egg protein	In general, egg protein doesn't have the best taste.  Since it has a mild flavor, mixing with other ingredients (e.g. bananas) work well.	1	0
		A2TB91BKWWY6N1	Greenies	My dogs look forward to this treat every morning. It helps the breath issue and satisfies the chewing need as well! I can't be without them.	0	0
		A2HG5XHSQDBLG9	Save money	For people watching weight or nutrition,these chips are an excellent substitute for regular chips.  They have plenty of protein as well.<br />Amazon's price is much cheaper than buying packs at the local grocery store.	3	0
		ARMT5S0PF0W5P	Royal Oak Peanuts	The Royal Oak Virginia Salted Peanuts are great. I would highly recommend these<br />and will reorder from time to time. I bought two 2 packs, a total of 4 40 oz cans.	0	0
		A1K4KGJRRCY7MZ	Pretty Good GF Substitution	These brownies are a pretty good substitution to regular brownies.  They're nice & chocolate-y!  I've served them to some friends who aren't on a gluten-free diet & they say they wouldn't have known the difference if I didn't tell them.  I recommend them!	0	0
		A1Q9CRXICY363I	Great way to purchase Sugar-in-the-Raw.	I've always like Sugar-in-the-Raw but it is usually too expensive. Amazon has this priced very reasonably and I've been buying it regularly. I also try to avoid any food with hi-fructose corn syrup, and this sugar is what I like.	0	0
		A24RMGMOIXC88V	great northern popcorn	I just love it, the popcorn pops fast and when it is done you have real old fashioned movie theater popcorn just like the old days	4	0
		AIFK11FY4SUXY	Tamarind makes a delicious stew	Tamarind paste gives delicious slightly sour taste to dark meat of chicken, pork and beef.<br />Make a stew without potato, because potato is not good in a sour dish.<br />Add 1 table spoon of tamarind to 2 lbs of meat and 2 onions.<br />Dry oregano, cumin powder, salt, pepper and garlic to taste.<br />Mix everything and cook till ready.<br />99% of your guests will like the dish very much.<br />For lean parts of beef use tamarind to marinade meat overnight before cooking it in a slow cooker.	3	1
		A28RMYGO9RGA0K	french's roast'n bags	i love this product cant find it locally. Sometimes little out of the way stores have it.But i also love the chicken,pork chop bags.Every store i go in i look for them the lastplace i found it was at a meat market.	0	0

		A1B5T3IUHLZ2UU	FLAVORED COFFEE??	Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it. Hopefully I can pawn it off to visitors and buy some regular bold coffee-flavored coffee for myself!	7	3
		A32XGYDA14KT13	Well I really kinda cheated.....	When I saw that this product was being offered to us as a VINE product for testing and feedback, I immediately ordered it.  The reason that I consider it a cheat because this is already a product I know and love and this was a chance to get some MORE.  LOL<br />I love the ease of opening the packet, adding water, putting it in the microwave for two minutes then stirring and adding some milk and ENJOY!  I love this oatmeal and the maple brown sugar is my favorite flavor.  This is definitely a recommendation to buy and enjoy.	0	0
		A2E1VCI6QCP8WL	Great first cereal!	My six month old baby loves it. It seems to be her favorite food. It also is easy for her to digest, and I love the fact that she's already able to get probiotics in her system. It's the perfect first cereal!	0	0
		A1GQAKL9CGQLP1	Great Gift for the Holidays	I love giving and receiving these Lindor Truffles Assorted Gift Boxes for the holidays.  They are delicious, bite-sized gourmet chocolates that are individually wrapped.  The wrapping looks like miniature gifts with the sparkly and festive colors that look pretty around the holidays.  They look almost like miniature Christmas tree bulbs.  With the assorted flavors, everyone can find one they like at least.  And it's fun to sample the different flavors.  Dark chocolate truffles are included and everyone knows now that dark chocolate is good for you.  (Chocolate is a vegetable, after all--chocolate is a bean.) These seem to have popular appeal--even my sons and their friends like them. The host/hostess can put these out for a party, and save some for their family.  They keep well in the wrapping and are a perfect after-dinner mini dessert.  I find one is enough for a tasty treat.  If you like chocolate, you should enjoy these bite-sized chocolate treats.	4	0

		A135EEFOPQTJ1F	4 0z. Great Northern Popcorn  ~  Delicious	A+  I bought this product to use with my new 4 0z. Popcorn machine.  The flavor is absolutely delicious!  I agree with the other reviews that I've read...it tasted just like theater popcorn!  There were a few old maids left that didn't pop but I will buy more when my supply runs out.	0	0
		AUKES5H8YTOEE	Dogs refused to eat it	"I expected Newman's Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, ""We are NOT eating this stuff.  Period.  No Way.""  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newman's in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But it's not Newman's."	2	2

		AVFP6Y641X6CZ	COTTAGE CHEESE RECIPE...	I have always used SPIKE on cottage cheese.  It's an old trick. NOW... finely chop some green onion tops, some parsley and some garlic.  Mix that into small curd Cottage Cheese, season with SPIKE. Chill.  Even great on toast. High protein and delicious!	3	0
		A27O5ZUFAEWT9L	Meets the Picky Cat Taste Test	"My youngest cat is very particular about what he eats.  He absolutely will not eat if something doesn't meet his expectations.  Between that and the recent pet food recalls, I've had a really hard time finding cat food that I can feed him.  I'm happy to say that the Merrick Southern Delight clicks with him, plus it has no wheat gluten or other fillers.  The texture of it is appealing, too . . . it's not just ""mush"" or Spam-looking like many foods.  I'll continue to buy Southern Delight and plan to also try out some of the other Merrick flavors."	3	0
		A2FF6O16COSI93	BBQ Rub	I've been trying to find a good paprika for a rub used in the smoker. This stuff is the absolute best that I've found. It's sweet but still has all the flavor you want from paprika without being overly smoky. If you make homemade rubs, I strongly recommend this stuff.	0	0
		A1TLH7LQZE70IK	Simply Amazing,	Although they taste somewhat like Granola bars but yet, Super in Taste, Extremely Healthy, Balanced Diet, and after all my No. 1 Choice.	1	0
		AJXA1LEPPNFW4	Not great	My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance. We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before.	2	4
		A1FXQS81ND2GYY	Good tea	Nice robust flavor.  Tastes very good with cream and sugar or black.  I will continue to buy it.	5	0
		A1MJS2BIKE44ZP	Great for ferrets too!	On the first offer my ferret didn't want the treat. But a couple of days later I noticed him trying to steal the whole bag, so I offered a piece again. This time, and ever since, he's loved it. Go figure!<br /><br />I like this treat for ferrets because the pieces are appropriately sized (ie- small) for a ferret, and the ingredients and stats are superior to most ferret treats! His digestion has been less affected by these than by many ferret treats also :)	0	0
		A5DNLV9G9J1C5	K-cup coffe	We were very pleased with this product and the short time in which we received it.	1	1
		AXT0PC65KS84R	disappointed	I ordered two 24 can packs of 11.5 oz. V-8 juice, which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer. When i opened the box, although all the flip-tabs appeared to be intact, one can had leaked some of it's contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box. I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and that's how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i don't turn up with salmonella down the road. Since this was a UPS delivery, i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package. Usually get superior service from them. I have ordered like this in the past, and the product arrived in perfect condition, so as i said, i was disappointed this time.	0	1

		A41JQE7UEDX7Y	German Shepherd's Favorite	My girl has loved these for two years.  When the local retail outlet, Trader Joes, no longer carried them-we found the manufacturer.  This is one of the few treats Wilhi Girl enjoys.	0	0
		A3UBHAGQW18FDR	Would buy again	These are pretty good. I haven't tried any other brand of these but just judging this brand alone I would buy again. The price is good and the product taste great. I eat 12 of them as a lunch so they don't last very long.	0	0
		A2ZM4BI08T884J	Love it!	I really like the flavor of this one! It has a low acidity but still full of flavor! Now I have to have it every morning and I am having trouble finding another one I like this much.	0	0
		A3H0B2IQ78XAUM	Wonderful product	Love these sprouting seeds.  The mixture adds a tangy interest to the sprouts.<br />Great in salads and on sandwiches.  We live in a remote area with limited access to fresh produce.  These sprouting seeds add freshness to our sandwiches and salads.	0	0
		A2XMSLLYHDZXQH	Very dissapointed.	I truly was looking forward to using these flavored syrups for making Latte's and other coffee drinks. First of all I do not like Splenda sweetener because to me it has a lingering after-taste. I had hopes that the flavored syrup would at least hide the bad taste but to me it only seems to make it worse. I will buy the Torani Flavored syrups again but only in the sugar sweetened versions.The true flavors of these Sugar Free syrups seems to be overpowered by the Slenda after taste.	2	4
		AR4R0I0ISSUJ5	My 2 Dachshunds love these	My two little boys love these treats. So much in fact that I've been cutting them in half so they can have them more than once a day. I honestly can't say that they reduce tartar but I can see how they would with their chewy texture.	0	0
		A2T5Y84ZTY0F7F	Love, Love , Love Revv Pulse!	I ordered regular Revv not knowing if it was all a gimmick and was very pleased with the coffee. I work overnights so I figured the Revv Pulse would be a plus so why not try it! Wow, this K-Cup really delivers on taste and yes it did give me a boost! I cant fake the funk at work all night and a couple cups of Revv Pulse (over ice with creamer is my preffered way to enjoy coffee) had me alert and awake for my whole shift! Both Revv & Revv Pulse are strong coffees so if you are looking for something light this isnt it. Its bold but not bitter which is what I enjoy and stands up great against a full glass of ice. I wasnt able to taste anything strange or any type of herbal tastes. I am very happy with both my Revv & Revv Pulse purchases. Side note: I bought Revv Pulse here through Amazon only because both Green Mountain and Keurig.com are sold out of it at the moment. Its cheaper by almost 10.00 on the other sites.	0	0
		A1TPGWR8AZTT9	Not what I ordered.	I got two Teas and one type of iced coffe and the rest were HOLIDAY COFFEES and APPLE CIDER!  Spicy Eggnog? Gingerbread? Bait and swtich.  The only redeeming factor - Amazon was great and issued me a refund.	2	0

		ANU0095EMJBCT	Tasted Great... For About 3 Weeks	I was a bit dismayed that there wasn't an expiration date on the box or on any of the individual packages. The popcorn tasted great for about 3 weeks and then it just tasted stale. Gross, I had to throw out over half of the product.	0	1
		A924TGDY44X4X	Great snack	I don't actually eat much milk and cereal, but I do snack on frosted mini-wheats throughout the day. I just grab a handful here and there when I'm hungry and looking for a snack.  There IS some sugar added obviously, but there's also a lot of fiber.  When compared to a typical snack, this is the far healthier choice.  Loved them when I was a kid and I love them now.	2	0

		A3NY87GDWM51U7	Disappointed	It seems alot of items on Amazon get undeserved glowing reviews.  I tried these (original and chocolate) because of the reviews but they're nothing special. I'm sure I'll end up throwing them away when they go stale.  This has happened to me before so I wonder if Amazon pays people to write reviews?	0	4

		A34NVQTFD4QYJ0	good, not great	I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.	0	0
		A1REUVV0JG6S1F	Really great gluten-free brownies!	The Gluten-Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is so easy to make and tastes heavenly.  I combined two packages and baked the brownies in a large cake pan, then cut them into serving size and froze them.  They taste as good after being frozen as they did the day I baked them.  In my book, these brownies taste better than anything sold in the supermarkets as regular wheat-containing brownies.  I recommend the mix to anyone hungry for the real thing!	3	0
		A25IUSELS10P2L	Choked & Barfed- see video	"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>So this might be a gross video to watch... but I'm posting this so that others might see what they are in for.<br /><br />I have an adult boxer dog with dental problems (gum overgrowth, as do most boxers) so I bought several dental health products-including these chews.<br />I bought the large size chews, and for the first half of the chew (they are rectangular shaped), it worked great.<br />Then towards the last bit, he didnt know what to do with it. It wasnt firm enough that he could hold it and chew on it, he had to put the whole thing in his mouth and chew on it. He tried to swallow it, then realized it was too big, so kind of hacked it up, and kept chewing. I started filming during this part, to show how the hacking becomes problematic, but you can see that at the end of this video, he barfs the whole thing up.<br /><br />I think that in theory, enzyme-assisted dental care is great, but probably should stick with the toothbrushes/toothpaste so that it is controlled and doesnt become a choking hazard.<br />I think I will stick with tooth-brushing followed by a small mint-flavored treat to reward the toothbrushing.<br /><br />I wanted to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this should seem as much a hazard as any other rawhide/toy, however here is why I think that is wrong: This big flat rectangle shape seems to add problems to breaking down into smaller pieces, whereas the twisted rawhides allow for holding between their paws while gnawing down to a small piece. I will stick with the latter shape in the future."	2	1

		A1H6J2BIU9LIW3	Just What I Wanted	I had this chai tea at a local restaurant and loved it.  After searching all over for it I finally found it here at Amazon and was quite pleased. Though I think it is a little expensive, I haven't found any quite as rich and satisfying.  One caution is that it's fairly sweet and higher in calories and saturated fat than I wish it was, but the taste makes up for it.	0	0

		A2UGMUPCW2ZVSH	Hope you have sharp teeth	Hope you have sharp teeth cause this jerky is tougher than your grandpas leather shoes.

		A1HLP1ZEW5GCEO	Great Treat and Fresh Breath Too	I've tried both the Peanut Butter flavor and the new Dental paste. My dog loves them both.

		A2CUXNQJT8Y38G	passion	amazing taste, incredible quality. This is the best beef jerky I have ever had. I think it's even better than the other non-halal ones. This beef jerky made me leave my first review ever on amazon though I'm a regular costumer of theirs. Thumbs up!	1	1
		A3VSMSEGHLS0PU	Fooled My Friends!	This is THE best gluten-free pasta ever. I have used it for pasta salads that I served to friends, and they never knew they weren't eating regular pasta. One caveat--be sure to not overcook it, or it will get mushy. I've tried all the Tinkyada shapes, and they are all good, but the fusilli is my favorite because it's so versatile.	0	0

		A8343K7CN8LT4	Awesome, big, my Pitt loves them...low fat too	Great treats, my Pitt needs weight control snacks and these treats are amazing. He loves them, and they have like sixty calories each, plus they are big, almost thr size of a pinky finger. My pup gets one after doing his business in the yard, and they satisfy him. I am glad I found this product and I will be ordering it again. Also, the bag is large so it lasts a while. A good value and an awesome item for dog owners. Perfect of medium or large breed doggies.	0	0
		A2TXEZS99BQHID	WHY DOES IT TASTE SPICY??...EWWW	This is the worst energy drink I ever tasted. It has a really big spicy flavor to the drink. The spicy to the drink over powers it and its impossible to even finish one out six. I even tried giving the other five away for free and people would do the same thing I did throw it away. So I really spent about $19.00 down the drain.	5	7

It's not too strong of a coffee, but not too weak of a coffee either, it has a great blend of flavor.  It has a smooth taste and is not to bitter like some coffees tend to be.  Good price on this brand as well.  Overall I would have to say this a keeper for my morning ritual.	0	0
		A2R6SB61DQ1VXU	This is areal maple syrup!	"I rarely get excited enough about food products to write reviews, but this maple syrup deserves it!<br /><br />I've been buying real maple syrup for years. At the supermarket, Whole Foods, Costco, what have you. I've NEVER been satisfied with the artificial stuff. All these years I thought I had tasted good maple syrup. Well, I hadn't. I've never been a stickler for the ""Grades"" or locations, but I guess I've been mostly buying Grade A mediums and darks from Canada.<br /><br />At first glance, the maple syrup is really dark. A bit watery, but I think good for pancakes and such (what I bought it for). However, as soon as you taste it, WOW! Flavors of maple trees with the cool wind in your face come to life. And it's not as sweet as the competition, which is good for me, since I want more of that mapley taste!<br /><br />I will be buying this syrup as my go to brand for a while to come."	2	0
		A1KLJFICL4YVXD	Love the taste!  Best bang for the buck maple syrup!	Tastes great, and it's a quality product at a price a few dollars cheaper than the alternatives, even at our local supermarkets.  It's tough to find Grade A medium amber syrup in pints.  I'll probably just keep ordering these a few times a year.	0	0
		AHA9SPGZX4OE	Happy to have found this product	With all of the choices of things to drink, this is an excellent one. It tastes great. Most of our choices are either loaded with sugar, or carbonated ... even milk is sugar-dense. This drink is good for blood pressure and cholesterol. It is an excellent thirst-quencher. So much better for the hot summer months than sugary lemonade! It does, however acidify the pH. I am supposed to be alkalizing my diet, so I can't drink a lot of this. :(<br /><br />From the time I was a small child, my mother was an advocate of apple cider vinegar and honey for health. Hippocrates would have been happy to discover Bragg Organic Apple Cider Vinegar All Natural Drink: Concord Grape Acai :))) Try it and drink to good health!	3	0

The individual portion size helps us, and we love having the freshness these provide.  The cost is excellent as well.  And the container recyclable.	0	0
		A1IZO66SHI6X12	Superior Quality Saffron	I have been buying saffron from them since the past three years and they have never failed me. Have ordered like 8 of these 1 ounce tins for family and they keep asking for more.<br />The quality of the saffron is fantastic. You can tell by the smell. It is a little pricey, but it is how it is. Saffron is one of the most expensive spices out there and you get what you pay for. But the upside is, only a little is enough. We have even divided these into 5 portions and put them in a decorative case to give them as gifts after our daughter was born. People actually call to ask where we get our saffron from.<br /><br />I am really happy with the product and will not try anything else.	0	0

I had trouble with the taste so I add sugar and a little peppermint extract and it is a very pleasant drink.  I have a cup morning and evening and now am able to sleep much better. I also find I am not exhausted and dont have that anxious feeling. I would advise anyone to try this as it has helped me so much.	16	0
		A19AQ9XD92OIHC	Maybe the best damn chocolate chip cookies ever!	the friends who introduced me to this don't even eat gluten-free but they use this as their chocolate chip cookie mix because they think this is the best chocolate chip cookie you can make!<br /><br />I love this mix!!! It is also way, way better than Bob's Red Mill's gluten-free chocolate chip cookie mix (which is too bad, because I really like them & most of their products)<br /><br />great texture, great flavor, great density (not solid but not too airy)	1	0
		A1P2XYD265YE21	Perfect Blend of Flavor, Healthy Components	Switch Kiwi Berry is the perfect blend of tangy, tart, and sweet, with a delicious dose of kiwi flavor and subdued berry taste.<br /><br />This drink is bubbly, but better than a soda because:  1 - it is clean, not sticky, 2 - it is 100% fruit juice, 3 - there is no added sugar, 4 - there is no added anything else that is bad.<br /><br />This is a healthy drink, but it could trick us into believing it is bad.  I have only good things to say about Switch drinks, and can't think of one bad thing about it.<br /><br />This drink would be a perfect substitute for soda with whatever you would normally drink soda with, such as:  sandwich and chips, pizza, tacos, grapes and cheese and crackers, nachos.	0	0
		A3HQAPXAJV7PRX	Where have you been all my life?	"I've never heard of these chips, but when I was offered the chance to review them, I got the Popchips Sweet Potato. DH had a heart attack last September and, after getting two stents put in, has had to cut out all of his beloved snacks, largely due to the high fat content and sodium (especially the sodium). I've been looking for something ""snacky"" with reduced sodium that isn't awful, and these are just the ticket. One .8 ounce bag, one serving, is a nice round 100 calories with only 3g of fat (.5g polyunsaturated, 2g monounsaturated), no cholesterol, 16g carbs, and 95mg of sodium. They have a bit of a salty taste, and they aren't very sweet with only 2g of sugar. I think they'd make an interesting dip chip with a plain-yogurt-based dip.<br /><br />I liked these Popchips so much that I got the next lowest sodium kind, the Chili Lime Potato flavor with 170mg of sodium and everything else the same except 1g of fiber. DH can have no more than 1500mg of sodium per day, but considering I'm using mostly frozen vegetables and not adding any salt to anything, I think he can have a bag of these on occasion without worry. And yowie zowie! What a big burst of flavor! The Chili Lime Potato Popchips are definitely the go-to chip when you've got to have something that tastes really ""bad for you.""<br /><br />I expect we're going to be signing up to get our Popchips delivered regularly via Amazon subscription. If we had been eating these Popchips instead of the regular high-fat/high-sodium/high-carb fare all along, I expect we'd both be a lot healthier now. A highly recommended product."	0	0

		A35N0EICBY7X8J	Bit salty, but otherwise excellent.	I'm not a huge fan of salt, so take that warning with a grain of, well... you know.  For most people the salt on these is probably fine.  They stay crispy over long periods of storage, even after the package has been opened and split into tupperware containers, they're reasonably sturdy, they pair well with all but the saltiest cheeses (wouldn't put blues on them), they pair GREAT with unsalted pb... just a great all-around cracker to keep in the house.  They've become a staple of my diet and, unlike every other cracker I've bought in bulk, and there have been many, they haven't developed some weird off-flavor due to over-familiarization or the cracker becoming stale.  They still taste good, like a simple cracker.  I'll be ordering them again!	0	0

		A2X1XBJOQXQ3W8	Dry with after taste	I am in the health food industry and I am gluten intolerant.  I have tried many different GF cookies in the last ten years.  I bought a box of Lucy's chocolate chip cookies last night at Safeway.  I was not impressed.  The cookie was dry, almost to the point of being stale. This is a common problem when people try to make a gluten free cookie that have no experience in baking with gluten free flours.  Lucy's cookies remind me of Pamela's cookies which are also dry.  Being dry is not a sin that a little milk or coffee can not take care of.  However what I cannot stand is an after taste.  The base flour combination has an odd after taste that spoiled the little enjoyment I had from this cookie.  I looked at the ingredients and found garbonzo and fava bean flours.  I cannot recommend this cookie based upon the after taste.  I have not tried the other varieties that may have stronger flavors to cover up the after taste.  I would suggest either Udi's frozen cookies or Glutino cookies.  I find these two brands superior to Lucy's.  Thanks for reading.	1	0

		A6INT1B92QWXA	Not so great	I bought those chips after reading good reviews but I was very disappointed with the taste.

It was worth trying them but I am not going to purchase them again in the future.	3	7
		A26KVR3NKBA5VR	The Best Pretzels Around - no Contest!!	I love Pretzels and have to say that after trying my way through many different kinds, these are The BEST.<br /><br />The taste great, are REALLY crunchy - a key requirement for me - and have just the right amount of salt. The Newman's Rounds are just as good - maybe even better.<br /><br />And as an added bonus, Paul Newmann donates all his after tax profits from the sale of his products to charity - an unbeatable combination in my book!	2	0
		A1M47LJI5QV0HY	Healthy, easy to make, and apparently very tasty!	All three of my dogs LOVE this food -- even my ultra-finicky dog! It is human-grade food and full of every good thing. It is very, very easy to make, and meal-time has become a big deal in my house -- they all sit with wagging tails as I prepare it. When I stayed at my mom's house for a couple weeks, her two dogs were much more interested in having my dogs' food than their own regular dog food. I originally bought this food because I wanted to put my dogs on a vegan diet. For the protein source, I use tofu and all sorts of beans like chickpeas/garbanzo beans, black beans, etc. They love it no matter what I add to it. I rotate the type of oil I use, or sometimes I use a blend. When I first put them on this food, I used the serving size they recommend, and my dogs started gaining weight. So I am actually able to use less than what they say in the instructions. I have three 50-pound dogs and I use approximately 1 scoop per dog, twice a day. In the 10-lb bag there are about 198 scoops, in the 5 lb bag there are around 99 scoops, in the 20 oz bag there are around 24 scoops. So from that you should be able to calculate a good estimate of the cost for your dog(s). Of course for smaller dogs you can use less. With my finicky dog, I used to have to stand over him and goad him into eating his commercial dog food (which even contained meat). Now he scarfs his food every time! One other note: I sometimes add some Nature's Recipe Vegetarian formula dry dog food just to add some crunch. For vegetarian/vegan treats, I feed them Sam's Yams and C.E.T. VeggieDent. It is a wonderful thing to be able to give my dogs a cruelty-free diet! And we never have to worry about all those crazy dog food recalls!	3	0

		A2OETFZ7IA6XSQ	Great for colicky acid reflux babies	We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.	3	0
		A11S7AGHA0O976	La Tourangelle Avocado Oil	"An excellent product! ... and this particular brand seems to be better than others I have tried in the past. It has a very fresh flavor and can be used in a large variety of ways. It is pure and very tasty when used just as an oil on salads or vegetables, too. The unbreakable ""tin"" container sits in the back corner of my cooking counter and is also used whenever I'm not sure what ingredient I should add next in a recipe preparation!

		AJD41FBJD9010	hmm... dogs enjoy, but there are healthier liver treat options	"My dogs love these treats, and I do buy them occasionally because they are cheap and perched at the check-out counter of our local garden/feed store. But check out the ingredient list-- I don't think anyone can feel good about feeding their dog high-fructose corn syrup! Just not the healthiest option-- when so many of our dogs are overweight, it seems better to feed them a real liver treat, versus this product which is ""made with liver"".<br /><br />My dogs absolutely love <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000255OIG"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried 14 Ounce</a> (the larger size packages are more economical). I just feel a lot better about feeding real freeze-dried liver that doesn't have all the extra junk in Bil-Jac liver treats.<br /><br />Specifically, these treats have chicken ""by-products""-- that means liquid slaughterhouse run-off and other non-human grade leftovers from the slaughterhouse. UGH! Bil-Jac also includes three preservatives, glycerin (?!), and the corn syrup.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the ingredient list for Bil-Jac liver treats, so you can make your own decision:<br /><br />Liver, Chicken By-Products, Chicken By-Product Meal, Corn, Chicken Fat, Glycerin, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Propylene Glycol, Wheat Flour, Phosphoric Acid, Salt, Sodium Propionate and Potassium Sorbate and BHA and Citric Acid (Preservatives), Iron Oxide."	2	1

		A2H5PWKGS0EKY	Very Pleased	"My chihuahua/dachshund developed a horrendous skin allergy which got worse when he went outside. He scratched so much, we took him to the vet for a shot, prednisone and antibiotics. I had read about the benefits of Avoderm, and already was feeding them this dog food. I also have a miniature schnauzer. I noticed, when I didn't have Avoderm for a week, but did have Blue Buffalo which is also high quality, that my mix began to shed noticeably. When I bought more Avoderm, he hardly shed. That alone, is reasons for Avoderm. We also bath him with Avoderm shampoo which works effectively with this dog food. He is still on Prednisone, and I bought the largest bag of Avoderm available. With my schnauzer, I've noticed minute changes...no outside odor when she comes inside, breath smells better, even better mood and more running and jumping. She is older.<br /><br />Another benefit, and this is a huge plus, they seem to empty their bowls instead of letting it sit in the evening when they are fed. My mix is still of puppy age so I feed them ""All Stages no grain"" dogfood. It's not the cheapest, but the benefits make it worth it. I'm very pleased."	0	0
		ABNYRKPS270BG	Answer to my lil munchkins severe allergy	my daughter who is 8 months old is on this meyenberg goats milk from 6 months... all i can say is she is an entirely different baby now.<br />She was a colicky baby, severe eczema flares now and then (inflammation and oozing most of the time) .. doctors asked me to try different<br />hypoallergenic formulas which she refused to take just a table spoon in her regular formula.. I gave up hope that she would ever change her formula.<br />in the process i was reading about goats milk and its various benefits. I spoke to the dietitian gastro doc and her pediatrician but none of them agreed<br />that i should feed her the goats milk because it is not nutritionally good for the baby. I was very upset because all i knew was my daughter has cow's milk allergy<br />and she was been fed cows milk despite of the fact it was making her colicky, making her skin worse day by day and she has severe reflux problems. I decided to try this<br />product and luckily i was able to find it in whole foods.. made one bottle and gave it to my daughter while she was asleep. to my surprise she drank it all and she slept<br />good for straight two to three hours which never happened in the last 5 months. though she did not liked the taste later and i had to give her with the ratio of one ounce<br />goats milk to five oz enfamil, now she is doing 5 oz of goats milk to one oz of enfamil. What a dramatic change<br />No Colic, beteer Skin with no oozing or hyper inflammation (i sometimes apply on her milder inflammation 0.5% cortisone)she is still on pepcid for her reflux but she is doing<br />better where as her spitting is concerened alomost 0 spitting (before she use to keep on puking now and then). I look at her and thank God for making me decide on this product<br />as she is a Happy baby now. i can only imagine better for her what will she be like when completely on the goats milk. I have to supplement her with the multi vitamins.<br />I took her recently to her pediatrician, her GI their exact words (her skin has never been this good before)the dietitian is working on my daughter's diet plan to make sure<br />she gets all the nutrients which are essential for a growing baby...<br />I did not wanted to make the trips to the whole foods everytime and pay a higher price for this product when Amazon is selling on a great price of 3 cans.. the shipping is free<br />and the package arrives right on time before i am out of the stock ( you need to order this product before a week so u never run out of it) The packaging is good and the cans are not<br />damaged or dented.<br />Great product<br />Excellent providers Amazon	2	0

That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice bread. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, ""Sparkling Orange"". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This brought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick. Today is a perfect example, I worked a full shift on 8 hours of sleep, 8am-4pm, worked out at the gym from 9pm-11pm, slept 2 hours, and got up to go into work at 4am, pickup a few hours of overtime, drank a can and I am feeling GREAT. The energy boost is enlightening. So if you are looking for a good energy booster at a better price than most, this is it for you. I love Monster Absolute zero, but it is more than twice the price per can."	1	0
		A3UCN2RGY7O6S1	A great find	Dieting since mid-May using whole grains in pastas, rice, etc, and this orzo in whole wheat is just not able to be found anywhere but here--so happy to find it. (Now if I could also find whole grain orecchiette too, hint). With 9 grams of fiber per 2oz serving, this orzo delivers high fiber, just what I wanted.  Use it in rice dishes like pilafs and stuffed peppers, add to soups, or just serve as a side dish on its own w/butter and sage, etc..no need to go back to white orzo anymore.	2	0

		A27UAV5WNW3OWL	get up & GO !!!	This stuff is fantastic. I agree with the other complimentry reviews. might i suggest mixing a small amount of this powder with a shot of olive oil?! I actually think it may lengthen the effect even mnore by doing this and it is a fat soluble so it's a lot easier to get down. Because of the chemistry of this molecule, it is bitter and never tastes good. If it really bothers you, it's possible to order some gelatin capsules and make your own guarana capsules! That way you can swallow them and will not have to deal with the taste:)	1	0
		AR38UO36XB7MR	Darn good? Naw, it's HELLA good!!!	Easy to make, and made as directed is tame enough for even the biggest wussy in your life. For the more daring, it makes a great base to experiment on top of. The simmering time on it is not long, and maybe it's just me, but seems to get better the longer it's simmered. I usually go for 3 hours.<br /><br />I've officially stopped buying canned chili since stumbling across this at the store! I would recommend this to any chili fan for when you're to lazy to do it from scratch. Seems pricey here on Amazon though since i've bought mine for $4 a pack average at most stores such as Wal-Mart & WinCo.	0	0
		A170TMX43WWB7U	wonderful	This tea is awesome.  I used to order it at a restaurant that has since closed down and have had a hard time finding hibiscus.  If you make it really strong it is delicious mixed with lemonade.	1	0
		A1ZIL7YH0VMW7C	Excellent!	I haven't tried eating it. I bought it to make vegan DIY pore strips. It totally works! Hooray! I didn't have much luck when microwaving it, but if you boil it like it says on the bottle it firms up quite nicely. Bear in mind, you must add soy milk to make the pore strips. The agar simply doesn't have the ability on it's own.	1	2

		A1NYKD19R5JQWD	really disappointed	though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did	0	0
		A386QLKG2EEYEI	Excelent value	Let me start out by saying this bulk tea bag comes with a lot of Hibiscus flowers.  A little bit of hibiscus goes a long way.  I've even reused the the flowers after I am done with my drink.  I recomend this product for anyone who likes hibiscus or sour drinks in general (of course it can be sweetened up too, just like lemonaide.)<br /><br />Pros:<br />Excelent Value<br />Quality flowers<br />Great taste<br />A lot of product<br /><br />Cons:<br />Some flowers are a little gritty -- easily solved with tea strainer/sifter	1	0

		A9ELUY7JBX3K3	Perfect blend	I've always hated the Peete's or Starbucks burnt-bitter taste. This is a great blend, still strong without the burn roasting.<br /><br />FYI, low quality beans are burned to hide it's bad taste.	0	0
		A32M0YLNY5YXTG	Fresh and high quality	Cannot consider ourselves experts on North African or Middle Eastern cuisine, or having enough experience with Ras El Hanout to say the aroma and taste is better than competitors.

		A17AQQD8K5WB63	delicious	"This tea is great.  I cook it in gallon batches and sweeten it with agave nectar and keep it in the fridge.  I guess it ""worked"" because my daughter was born after just 4 hours of labor and 20 minutes of pushing.  I'm still drinking it since I had just ordered another 3-pack of boxes of it the day before our baby was born.  My husband loves the tea too and he doesn't even have a uterus."	5	1
		A3E28PS1DSTTOO	Best Packaged Gravy ever made (In my humble opinion)	My wife use to make homemade peppered gravy which would take a long time to make and a big mess also.  When we discovered this pepper gravy, we decided that there was no need for the time and mess to make homemade as this was as close as you can get to homemade and again without all the time and mess.  As indicated by others, the addition of other ingredients such as sausage is also quite simple.  We would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys peppered gravy.	2	0
		A3F8PEV0YXC87A	thick, moist, chewy pieces of something	Not a bad taste, maybe too sweet.  The pieces are fairly thick, it felt like chewing on a piece of thick slightly undercooked bacon.  Meat quality seemed good when you did not find a stringy things.  Needs to be cooked longer.	0	1
		A39Q2NUVJF92X8	Quaility peas. great price	Peas taste as good as those I've bought at the market but are much cheaper per ounce! I store these in the big bag they came in, with a twist tie, and eat them out of an old can that I refill from the bag periodically. I snack on these at work and will be set for months! Only warning: the wasabi on mine is white, not yellow, not that it matters.	1	0
		A2F8YLIDDRJRSA	Buyer beware (of the vendor)	I ordered 15 boxes of this flour, or at least that's what I thought!

		A7EJERNB7IK3Z	Fantastic health product that tastes great!  Now THIS is real honey!	We all know and have heard of the benefits of pure, organic honey that is not adulterated or pasteurized.  There are countless articles on the internet that describe the health and even curative benefits of pure honey.  Greek mountain honey is no exception.  It is truly one of the last great tasting honeys of the world, with health benefits if imbibed in reasonable amounts.  This honey tastes very different than the typical, commercial and pasteurized junk you find on your mass supermarket shelves, so at first, you may be unsure about the taste.  Rest assured that not only is this honey delicious, with amazing flavor and notes- it is also one of the healthiest and purest honeys made by unique bees that differ from the ones in North America.  I even used a Greek honey and organic cinnamon/lemon juice regimen to rid myself of a cough and sore throat due to a flu! It worked like a charm.	2	0
		A3OGE84FAHACSA	Excellent Product	I have used this product for my Vizsla since he was a puppy. At the age of 6 1/2 because of this product he has very white and clean teeth without being brushed. This is also a special treat as whenever he is left home alone he gets a chew.  He senses when we are leaving and will stand by his treat table waiting for his chew.  I highly recommend this product.	0	0
		A3C00N4UHA5XYX	Very Pure. No Added Fat. Good Price.	I've been buying this for some time. It's expensive but I only eat it once in a while. But now my teenage daughter has discovered it and I can hardly keep the pantry stocked. So I'm glad I thought to check on amazon. With Subscribe and Save it's cheaper than I ever find it in the store (and only one store in my area carries it).<br /><br />What a great food for a teenager to be eating! She makes a parfait with granola, berries and yogurt.<br /><br />Ingredients: whole grain rolled oats, evaporated can juice, pineapple juice concentrate, pear juice concentrate, peach juice concentrate, vitamin E, natural flavor.<br /><br />It is very hard to find granola without added fat. And I really dislike puffed things like rice krispies in granola and it's hard to find that too.	0	0
		A1GNYKVAT4ZHT1	Yummy!	"I am an aficionado of chili. In fact, I cannot remember any chili -- canned or otherwise -- that I actually despised. This particular product is at the top of my list of favorites. It is so good, I order it by the case from Amazon.com. Still, if you like your chili ""hot"" (I don't), then skip this one. It does have all the other flavors, however, which appeal to my taste -- and to friends with whom I have shared this too guarded secret. C'mon Stagg, turn your advertising department loose! It's hard to find this product in my local markets."	0	1
		A34IC3J5YKKYTO	"My dog loves these! Closest I've found to the ""old"" greenies"	"My Maltese absolutely loved the old Greenies.  Then they changed their ""recipe"" and she wouldn't even try the new version.  Turned up her nose and that was that.  I can't recall the exact names of the other types of ""Greenies"" out there and there are only a few, but regardless, she didn't like any of them.  We moved on to another type of treat because I didn't think there was ever going to be another ""Greenie"" type treat that would measure up to the original.  On the outside chance she might like these, I gave them a try.  Turns out she really, really likes them.  So my search to replace the original ""greenie"" is finally over!"	1	0
		A154KKMNQPBB75	Once Great, now becoming less so	We've been getting these for our Newfie for some time.  Over the last few orders, there's been a noticeable degradation of the quality of the chews - It's now rare to get long thick strips - usually we get 2-4 of those in a bag of 30, with the rest being an assortment of either too short or too thin  to provide much more than 2 minutes of chewing.  I believe I'll be finding a new source.	1	0
		AXAAQ96YCKC9F	Wonderful anise flavor...	I tried these five years ago at a Greek cafe. They're sweet, with the pungent flavor of anise. I've looked for them over the years without success until a few days ago. I ordered them and they arrived a day before the estimated arrival. I couldn't be happier, the price is wonderful too.	0	0
		A3MQSTAAJSUGF9	Disappointed!	This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!<br /><br />I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.<br /><br />I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.<br /><br />To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category.	1	0
		A2UEE7YI6Y1PG4	Hickory flavor	The hickory flavor is repulsive.  I wound up throwing away 5.75 bags worth from my 6 bag order because not even the vultures at my office would eat this crap.  The texture of the beef is dry and mealy with almost a powdery quality to it.  Not moist, not tender, not flavorful, just disgusting.	0	2
		A3MZFG4EECNX7Y	Just a very good cookie.	"This is one of the few products I would buy even if I could have wheat products.  The cookie is not a ""soft"" type cookie.

		A27YPCR3ZXWVFE	So Delicious...Yet my companions wont touch them.	Great chips, great price.  Odds are that you will have them to yourself.  If you like your fish and chips soaked in malt vinegar, you will love these.  The best salt and vinegar chips I have ever had (and I love this flavor, mind you).  They are spectacular with deli sandwiches or on their own.  Since I have found that S&V is palatable to only the most intelligent of our species I know that my afternoon snack is all mine, unless of course I run into another heavy brained, hearty breathed like mind.  -Summary- If you like the taste of bitter sweet salty vinegar and a crispy chip to boot you wont pucker at the sight of these handily bagged morsels.  It is the first and only time I have committed to a whole case of chips and I will do it again.  Mmmmm... vinegar...	1	1

		AQF2SMXB950D9	Graham crackers good enough for Mommy to eat too!	"I LOVE these graham sticks.  They dissolve well and are super yummy (yes, I have eaten quite a few of them:).  I think they taste better than any other graham cracker I've tried, and they're organic to boot.  As far as sugary snacks go, they have pretty healthy ingredients. I like pretty much everything I've tried from Earth's best.  For those of you interested in how they're sweetened they contain organic invert syrup, organic evaporated can juice, and organic honey.  They don't have anything ""scary"" in them like maltodextrin or other such sweeteners.  Just vitamins and natural, organic products."	1	0
		A23S5J7UQRY6ZO	Much better than I expected	I haven't bought this online yet (I just saw it here for the first time today), but I've been buying it locally for almost a year now. I originally bought it for a mocha dessert recipe in the South Beach Diet book. I tried it to make a latte and was pleasantly surprised. I hadn't expected much from instant espresso based on past experience with instant coffees. This is actually very good. I have only used it for lattes and mochas. I don't do espresso by the shot. I particularly like it when I go camping. I've shared it with fellow campers who also liked it. The flavor is rich and can be adjusted to taste by varying the amount per cup. It also has a light froth on top. I recommend it highly.	16	0
		A2TJF79D51E5GE	The best	This is the best truffle oil out there. They infuse good olive oil. Beware of those who use cheap oils instead! I keep buying this. The seller ships quickly and packs well. You can trust this delicious product!	1	0

		AV034084VX0FP	Very Pleased	I have been using this product for several months on an over weight, spayed, eight year old female Dalmatian. This dog has been ravenously hungry her whole life and constantly begged for food and stole food when given the oppotunity. Because of that, keeping her weight in check has been a battle. We even went so far as to have health screens done to make sure this wasn't a thyroid or other issue. I decided to try Lean Dog to see if maybe it would help with her appetite. I am pleased to say that it has been like a miracle for her. It has definitly taken the egde off of her appetite. She has dropped weight, her coat looks great and she just appears younger and happier. I like that the product has all natural ingredients and is not filled with drugs. I highly recommend this product for others to try.	0	0
		AJD41FBJD9010	my favorite coffee-- much better than the expensive brands	Nutty, smooth, subtle, with a WONDERFUL aroma-- I love this coffee sooooooo much.

		A2KHE353KJDQY6	So good I eat it straight from the jar!	I haven't ordered this item YET, so I can't speak to the customer service angle.  However, I have purchased this product at a local specialty food store that sadly no longer carries it and I must say it's one of the five greatest things I have ever put in my mouth.  It's so great I have literally eaten it straight from the jar! If you've never had lingonberries, they are crimson red, roughly the sized of blueberries, and taste a lot like sweetened cranberries, only better.  They don't have the acrid taste that cranberries sometimes have, but I will say that if you dislike cranberries, this may not be your favorite thing.<br /><br />Of all the lingonberry products I've tried - jams and preserves - the Fellix Preserves are my very favorite.  The berries are whole or in halves, the color is true and the fluid part is completely smooth, rich and has a dense texture.  The flavor is strong enough to stand up to the density and full flavor of a biscuit, but it's also great on bagels or english muffins or toast.  And although I haven't tried doing it, I've heard this is a great product to use in baking - this would be great in a berry muffin, or as a complement to game dishes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this!	7	0
		A1MF176W8X69JP	BAD BATCH	This was my second purchase of this product. The first purchase was great, but this 2nd must have been a defective batch. Most packs did not cook correctly because they were not sealed tight and opened during cooking. That caused them to burn or not cook completely. I did not send them back because I kept thinking, maybe the next one will be better, but I was wrong. There are a few packs left, but I'm hesitant about microwaving them. I will probably purchase some again, but it will not be anytime soon.	1	0
		AJXRXTXGA858O	Brilliant product!	I took one of these tablets, and the results were instantaneous. I drank some pure lemon juice, and it tasted like  very sweet lemonade. My Sister then tried it and spat it out immediately. I then tried a lime, which was delicious, and some cheese. I do not usually like cheese, but i after eating a little bit i was amazed at how wonderful it tasted with the tablets. I highly recommend this product, beacuse it will amaze you the moment you start tasting.	1	0

		A1S2R41MYHYF0W	Excellent quality	I purchased this product for my goats initially. I like to give a warm drink of molasses water to my does after they kid and I also give a tablespoon full to any goat that seems to be feeling poorly. It seems to give them a good boost when they most need it. I bought an extra bottle for the house because I have always loved a bit of molasses on my biscuits. Much of the molasses, even that labeled blackstrap, that I have been finding in recent years is bland and seems to lack flavor. This molasses is quite delicious, if you like molasses, and is rich and flavorful. It also has high iron content, higher than I was finding in other brands.	8	0
		AQJBTS8BXNJ9N	Popchips BBQ Potato Chips	By accident, I stumbled on this product a few months ago.  Absolutely love the Popchips BBQ Potato Chips.  I've tried ALL the flavors, but BBQ is my favorite.  I'm on Weight Watchers, and this is a great alternative to regular chips...and I don't feel one bit guilty after eating a bag!  I get the individual sized bags by the case...so they're always available.  Can't find them locally, but Amazon.com is the next best thing!	0	0
		A2YVRCZVZ1UF13	Try the bagels!	My son has celiac and I've tried many bread products since his diagnosis 6 months ago.  I hated all of them except this one.  The bread was good, but I tried the recipe on the bag for the bagels and they were great!!!! I was so pleased to have a decent bagel to pack in his lunch instead of those horrible smelling frozen ones.	0	0
		A3CIHP9FFPE9I3	I would not buy it	There is no one with celiac or gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance in my family, so I cannot really speak for the value of this product for them.  As for me, I don't think this is worth the money.<br /><br />Here are my test results:<br /><br />My 2 year old grandson loved them.  The 6 year old rejected them handily.<br />I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below.<br />They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that.<br />They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking for<br /><br />But:<br />They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs.<br />They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.<br /><br />Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.<br /><br />I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one. I find them filling enough to be satisfying. The grandsons love them and everybody is happy.	2	3
		A2X5PQ4WZBM0SZ	My yorkiepoo loves these.	I love that they are healthy for her.  She's tiny so a treat like this is almost a meal for her.  She is learning to be well-behaved thru use of this treat, among others.  Costco did have some recently, but they change their offerings all the time.	0	0

		A1ACM1CBGORBN1	Great dog food.	I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price.	1	0
		A1YZYHCKDK2K4I	My Pooch loves them	Since my pet does not like having his teeth cleaned, I have been giving him greenies for the past six years.  Each vet check-up confirms that he has no plaque buildup.  He is a picky eater but loves the taste of them as well.	2	0
		AYZN1Z659HKMX	My dog is a pupperoni-addict	One of my most favorite things about my dog is that she loves me.  She'd follow me anywhere.  So when I go to leave for work in the morning, she gives me this look like I'm breaking her heart and all my promises to be a good dog owner...until I give her a pupperoni.  Now, the last thing I do each time I hit the bricks is whip out a 'roni and my dog can't wait to see me go!	1	0
		AZW4SZ9XHXYAL	Love it!	We have a trolley style popcorn maker and used popcorn oil and popcorn bought at the grocery store at first. We had many unpopped kernels and the taste was only okay.<br /><br />Then I ordered a case of Great Northern Popcorn 8-Ounce Portion Packs. This popcorn is great! We love the taste even three days after popping on the occasion when it lasts that long. We just followed the instructions on the package and all is well.<br /><br />I was a little concerned when I first noticed the oil was in a soft, but solid state. It melts quickly though. The only complaint I have is that it is a little difficult to pour it all in at once, but this is due to the layout of my popcorn popper.<br /><br />We have had friends over for football parties and they have requested more popcorn.	1	0
		A13Q7ED2A7HW3X	Dented cans	"The pumpkin is good, but 7 out of the 12 cans arrived dented (and not just little dents).  I read that dents aren't a big deal unless they are at the seams of the cans (which most of these are at the top or the bottom). Would have been a good deal, but I'm definitely disappointed.  Like other reviews said, these dents don't appear to be from them being shipped as cans that were even packaged in the middle were dented, makes you think they are selling the companies ""seconds"" or something."	0	0
		A395S23BFSJGAN	Great distraction! I get so much done!	My dog is always by my side and I could never get anything done. Since we got this toy, my dog plays with it for hours!

		A2QDBPPBHENHZF	Did not work for me	"I've tried using a toaster/microwave/confection oven/stove to make these things myself, but I wasn't able to. I even tried barbecuing but was unable to get the chips to ""pop"". I verified my methods with a local grocery store clerk named Mat (his name has one ""T"", which seemed a little strange to me), but to no avail.<br /><br />I contacted customer support asking for instructions but they acted aloof and confused about their own product! I don't know why they couldn't just mail, or at least email me some popping instructions.<br /><br />Luckily I think even raw/unpopped they taste pretty good. People look at them funny at first, but after they try a few they basically devour the whole bag, completely unpopped..."	1	3

		A1MJSWI87ZME83	Delicious low cal treat	Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.<br /><br />It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories.	6	1
		AU3VZDTQH0J4M	These chips make me weak at the knees	These chips remind me of a long obsolete brand of chips we could get in middle school.

		A1RP76H33ZV6P5	Good chips and not bad for you	If you are trying to eat healthy (like me), but love junk food (like me), these are the chips for you.  I have given up potato chips and french fries in my quest to eat guilt free, but a sandwich just needs something on the side. These chips add a great crunch as a side to a sandwich, and are a great snack for only 100 calories. They have no preservatives, no artificial flavors or colors, no cholesterol, 0 grams saturated fat, o grams trans fat, and are gluten free. Ingredients are potato flakes, potato starch, safflower oil and/or sunflower oil, rice flour, sea salt. They would be great to pack in a school lunch or for an after school snack. I ordered them on the subscription plan, a case a month, but might have to add an extra shipment. Everyone I have given a pack to loved them too and came back for more.	2	0
		APCN5D71687JD	Makes perfect serving-sized portions	This is the second Beaba freezer tray that we've purchased, and still use both.  We bought the second tray so that we can make and freeze more baby food at a time.  The tray makes perfect-sized serving portions, and clean-up is very easy.  We run hot water over the back of each cup for one or two seconds, and the frozen food pops right out.  We store the individual servings in ziplock sandwich bags, makes it really easy to grab his food for the day and go.	1	0
		A3Q6FOE9W2O5QH	beautiful with Nordic Ware Beehive cake	"I put these on a Nordic Ware Beehive cake I baked for Rosh Hashanah last year for a centerpiece cake.  Everyone commented how cute the bees were.  I stuck some of them on toothpicks with a little cake frosting so some of them appeared to be flying around the hive.  I ordered them again for this year's apple cake centerpiece.  The bees face different directions so I put a pair in the doorway ""kissing"".  Beautiful addition to our holiday table."	1	0

		A6I1EZIX2J0RB	Fatal	Why aren't there more negative reviews on the site?  Greenies are known for the harm they've caused many dogs; just look it up to see for yourself.<br />Years ago, my Pomeranian died due to biting off a chunk of a Greenie bone and having it obstruct her intestine.<br />It was a painful and horrific death and I found out the same thing has happened to many other dogs to the fact that they are full of cellulose fiber.  There are many other types of teeth-cleaning bones out there that WON'T seriously injure your dogs.  They're probably cheaper as well.	6	8

		A7KILT6HJ133G	Fragile bottom splits easily	My dog loves the tug-a-jug. I've bought three of them and on all of them the bottom has split. The bottom edges and threads split and break off. My dog isn't particularly hard on the toy either, it's only used on the carpet and she doesn't swing it around into walls or furniture. She stands it up, knocks it over and drags it by the rope along the floor with her paws. I really want to recommend this product, but I can't afford to replace it every three to five uses.	0	0

		A1ZNOV6J5V7BUH	Finally.... I found my tea!	"I see there are no other reviews for this item yet. There need to be! It is great, and with recent changes in Twinings lineup, I'm sure more people like me are out there looking for a good replacement-- so I hope this will be helpful to some who are doing as I have done. I took a blind chance on this tea-- and I am so glad I did. I've been a fan of black currant iced tea ever since I first tried it. For years I used Twinings brand, but they have changed their formula and I have read many negative reviews, so I decided to look for a new brand. I tried several others and Mighty Leaf black currant has been the best so far.  If you are a fan of Twinings Black currant (the original) and/or you like the black currant iced teas served by Jason's Deli or Corner Bakery, you will probably really like this tea as it has a very similar taste. It is slightly stronger and has a little more of a ""bite"" than Twinings version did, (which I like)  and it is an excellent quality tea all around. There are several brands out there whose interpretation of what black currant tea tastes like is very far removed from this flavor I am familiar with. A few of them I tried were just downright weird. I am not really sure which black currant taste is more ""authentic"" to be honest, I just know what I like and I am very very happy with this tea. I will be buying this brand from now on for making my iced tea. It is well worth having to order it."	11	0
		A19NP8YYADOOSF	Delicious, great texture, 3 ingredients	I did a search on Amazon for Kettle reduced fat chips, hoping to find a good deal on Kettle brand chips.  I stumbled upon these Deep River reduced fat kettle chips, and liked the per bag price (works out to about $1.50 per bag, about half the price of a similarly sized bag of Kettle brand chips at my local grocery store).  I am so glad I ordered these.  I love the taste, and I love the texture, and never would have guessed they were reduced fat.  I particularly like the short list of ingredients: Potatoes, Sunflower or Corn oil, and Salt.  That's it.<br /><br />I do wish Amazon would make it easy to find the nutritional information...so, here are the basics: 12-chip serving (28g) is 120 calories, 6g fat, 1g fiber.<br /><br />I will definitely order these again.	1	1
		AKW5WFJ24WMW4	Love this stuff	I gave up sugar years ago. I'm so glad to see Amazon with this product... It's the only sweetener I use and this is the best price I've found. I buy the 46oz bottles and refill my smaller one's. Subscribe and save is the Best Value!	0	0

		A3KXHH08ICCD5S	A better alternative	We ordered a case, and it arrived in perfect condition, i.e., we did not have a problem with open bags/stale contents as some previous reviewers have had.  This is a better alternative to cheetos or other junk food, but I would not condsider it healthy--just a better-tasting, more natural junk food.  It is satisfying and, based on the ingredients and taste, I'd rather eat Pirate's Booty than cheetos.  I subsequently bought a bag of Veggie Booty and was pleasantly surprised, though its flavor is a little more unconventional than Pirate's Booty.	4	0
		#oc-R119LM8D59ZW8Y	Not So Sweet Treat!	I love chocolate so I was excited to see the Chocolate Sampler Gift Basket by Back Mountain Baskets available in Vine to review. After reading a few other reviews on the strange packaging, I was almost afraid to open it - who knows what I would find. My daughter had a strong chocolate urge so we pulled off the wrappers.<br /><br />Oh my gosh, it is hard to know what to say. What was this company thinking?<br /><br />Let's start with the packaging. At first glance the basket looks simple yet classy and attractive and boasting what appears to be an assortment of delectable chocolates. That illusion is lost once you have opened the package. There are paper wrappings around boxes with the product name. But the actual boxes are for common grocery items like jello, fruit loops, flan etc. Can you imagine diving into a box of truffles that say Kenzi on the surface only to find the box below is for jello? A box of jello whose expiration was several years ago. How long does one keep old cereal boxes around, but more importantly, why would you package gift basket chocolate in old jello and cereal boxes?<br /><br />One of the boxes has a computer generated label that has been cheaply made and taped to it.<br /><br />So what is in the box? Well in one I pulled out a bag of peanuts that had melted and then solidified in one chunk. In another were small brown things that I believe were supposed to be truffles. There were also some wrapped cheap chocolate such as a chocolate graham cracker.<br /><br />The entire basket was unappetizing and unappealing. I can't share how the chocolate tastes, because after pulling it out of jello and flan boxes and seeing the melted condition, there was no way I was eating it despite my love for chocolate.<br /><br />With proper packaging and shipping, there would be a much better result but as it is now, it should not be for sale.<br /><br />This is definitely not a gift basket you will want to give.	5	6
		A2SVLQVQ7QVDRW	Nice Substitute	"I love salt and vinegar chips, and when I found these in the store, I tried these and thought they were a great ""healthier"" substitute.

		ABCPXWIXY5KLM	Chinese Product Masquerading as American	"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our ""furry kids"" that won't make them sick or kill them!"	1	0

		A209WZE5WJFA7L	As good as the best BBQ sauce, maybe it is the best	"I grew up in the South and in seemed that in every county I lived in or tried BBQ in, there were raging controversies over which county and which BBQ restaurant had the best BBQ sauce.  There were mustard based sauces (South Carolina) that were not sweet, sauces sweetened with various ingredients, all types of sauce use this method except perhaps vinegar based. My father grew up in North Carolina so when we went to visit my grandmother in Goldsboro NC we ate the BBQ there with a hot vinegar based sauced which was quite good.<br /><br /> In short, I have tried just about every sauce out there including Mustard, Ketchup, Tomato, Vinegar and even Mayonnaise based BBQ sauce.  I would rate this as one of the best if not the best I've ever tasted.  The reason I don't rate it as number one is that I now live in the northeast and don't have access to many sauces that I used to, but this sauce is just astoundingly good and I've tasted maybe a hundred sauces in my lifetime, perhaps more than a hundred but probably less than 200.<br /><br />  I haven't had an opportunity to eat a Mayonnaise based sauce in years and as far as I know, no one is making a Mayonnaise based BBQ sauce but I would rank this sauce from what I remember Mayonnaise based tasted like, as in the top tier with the home made Mayonnaise based sauce that a man I know used to make,  but I haven't had that sauce in more than 25 years.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this sauce.  Incidentally, how did Mr. Larry come up with the name ""loose lipped""?  Does he talk a lot, gossip a lot, or is there some other secret behind the name that I'm missing?<br /><br />I have no affiliation with the company, have no interest in writing this comment other than I just love this sauce and I believe good things should be promoted.  And this sauce is more than good, it's exceptionally good, in the top tier with the best.  That's just my opinion though, try it for yourself.  You won't be disappointed.  The spice is slightly warm but not overpowering and if you're worried about it being too hot, you needn't worry.  This sauce is just slightly warm and that's one of its great benefits. Its sweet but not too sweet. It's got a combination of tomato and mustard and maybe some vinegar taste to it but I'm not sure about the vinegar.  It's just everything good about BBQ sauces rolled into one. And coming from me, you don't hear that kind of compliment very often.<br /><br />Even my wife likes it better than any other sauce4 I've brought home when coming back from trips down south. She eats it  on my famous home cooked pork tenderloins that  I cook quite often and that's saying a lot because she claims not to like garlic and I didn't let her in on the secret that garlic is one of the ingredients.  I only bought one bottle when I was down South and I'm sorry I let her try it because she finished off the bottle.<br /><br />I haven't tried the other sauce Mr. Larry makes but would like to give it a spin but for some reason  Amazon doesn't carry it."	2	0

		A206FFH5DBWL1H	Not impressed	"Despite the plethora of positive product reviews for these snacks, I see no reason to buy them again. Read those positive reviews and compare the content in some of them to the guidelines of a non-profit consumer organization for reviews. They contain a lot of ""Wow!"" with little specifics that would have been included by a true believer. Weigh the others as you will, but the proof is still in the pudding.<br /><br />The texture is their best asset (if you like that sort of texture); that's about it for me. They appear to be an extruded potato product (many of those out there) with various seasonings that do not impress me, either. The most basic of them puts 160mg of sodium into the TINY .8oz package. If you were a deer, you might eat them for that alone. The fat is reduced, that much is true. But...<br /><br />Unless you are ready to trade fat for sodium, it's no deal. But wait... baked kettle chips, in a 1oz serving, up the fat to... 3G, the same as the .8 of the basic flavor. You got .2OZ free on that one. The baked kettles possess 135mg sodium, vs. 160. These chips give you 1G fiber in .8 vs. 2 in 1oz of baked kettles. This product loses again.<br /><br />The only place you might 'gain' is in carbs 21 for the kettle chips, 15 for these, but remember... you have .2oz extra in the kettle's nutrition info... just about a wash.<br /><br />And then, topping it all - the cost... $0.92 an oz vs $0.44 for baked kettles in subscription. Wow. These wonderful snacks cost $14.72 per pound, packed as they are. The prices will fluctuate... but think about the things you can buy for that money instead. These are microscopic bags (that does not help the environment, either - portion control aside) with product largely deriving its kick from sodium and cheap spices.<br /><br />The most positive thing I can say is the product is packed very well. Lots of air in the bags to protect the chips, and they will mostly arrive intact in their tiny portions in tiny bags. You won't have many crumbs in the bottoms of these little bags, so that is a good thing.<br /><br />But... bottom line... expensive junk ""health food"". ""Wow!""."	0	1

Box (Pack of 2) does NOT mean Pack of 2 boxes	"The title of this product is ""Kelloggs Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bite-Size Cereal, 58.8-Ounce Box (Pack of 2)"".<br /><br />I naively believed was a pack of two Kelloggs Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bite-Size Cereal, 58.8-Ounce Boxes, partly based on the obvious interpretation of the title, and partly because it was way overpriced to be a single box.<br /><br />But it turned out that I actually got a SINGLE box of overpriced Kelloggs Frosted Mini-Wheats, Bite-Size Cereal, 58.8-Ounce Box.<br /><br />Sure, the box DID pack two separate BAGS of mini-wheats inside the one box, but that hardly qualifies as a pack of two BOXES."	3	0

		A1I34N9LFOSCX7	Yum!	This soup cooks up quickly and is very yummy! I really like the flavor of the seasoning packet and the way the noodles cook up, nice texture. It is very satisfying to me. I'm a single gal who doesn't really cook & am often in a hurry for my next meal, and I find that this soup really hits the spot. Although it does tend to be more of a mid-afternoon snack/light lunch item for me. It will tide you over for a while until your next big meal, but i have to agree with the other reviewer that if you try to have just one of these for dinner you can expect to be hungry in a few hours.<br /><br />Personally I LOOOVE this soup that much more because I had to give up the ramen cup o' noodle and some other brands i had been eating because I developed an allergy to shellfish and mollusks.  It seems that often these instant noodle packets/bowls either have some type of seafood in the sauce or they are manufactured on equipment that also processes shellfish. This one does not contain any type of seafood like many of the other instant noodles do. Another plus for me is that it's not spicy. I'm kind of a wimp with spicy foods, plus i have GERD/reflux, so believe me if i can eat it is NOT spicy. Just tasty :)<br /><br />One thing that bugs me a little is that i feel guilty about the packaging since the plastic bowl is not recyclable (in my town they only take 1's and 2's which of course these microwave safe bowls are never made out of.) Oh well, can't have it all....	0	0

		A2IFEAL3TLSB46	Great chocolate for cafe mochas	The difference between an average cafe mocha and a fabulous, smooth beverage to be savored, is in the quality of the chocolate. Mocha powders, ground chocolate and ordinary milk chocolate chips are no substitute.  Ghiradelli Barista Dark Chocolate Chips are the answer for intense flavor and pure, velvety chocolate. These Ghiradelli chips will turn your not-so-great, made-at-home mocha into a gourmet cafe.  Read more at mocha.[...]	5	0

		A1AG2UQFIVKQQ2	DARE COOKIES, COCONUT	I see that Dare has decided to cut-down on the filling, the cookies tasted the same, but i like them the way there were.  This was my second order and I was truly disappointed.  I open my box to find broken cookies and cookies that has been in heat and the middle has melted.  The quality was very poor.  I don't know who I should contact for a refund for the broken and melted cookies.  Can you help with this?? If this is not rectified- i will not be ordering any more.  Anybody out there want a box of broken cookies???<br /><br />After making my review, I recieved an e-mail from Amazon, they agreed to refund the cost of my damaged cookies.  I was shocked to see a company with compassion and honesty for their customers....they truly strive to provide good quality customer service.  This is very rare these days, but it is good to know a company out there truly cares.<br /><br />Thank you,	0	1

		APYZ6Y3B3FO6	Nice Tins	I emptied the contents of the tins and used them for other tea. The tea seems to give me bad gas.

		A3KJ6JZ8MWERPG	Big Disappointment	I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!	1	0

		A3FVKI0UH9DO2A	Occupies my dog for hours!	My 5-month-old Black Lab/Boston Terrier mix is a very curious puppy. We have been looking for toys that are interactive, as well as durable. This keeps her occupied for at least an hour (sometimes more), and after a week it doesn't show any signs of wear. We do give this only under supervision, as she has been known to destroy other rope toys :) This is one of our favorite purchases for our dog, and it's just as good as the Kong Wobbler!	1	0
		A2CE6Z4DX4K6DG	Chalky Chocolate Truffle	I purchased the product for a Christmas gift and assumed that coming from Bellagio it would be perfect.  The person I gave it to tried one packet and gave the rest away.  She said it smelled great but tasted chalky and wouldn't drink any more of it.	1	0
		A2RURE29UAL9FW	Be careful of the tomatoes	Our 15mo old daughter has really liked most of the other Happy Baby foods (she LOVES the Gobble-Gobble & Mango-Spinach-Pear).

Yet I write this drinking one, so I can stay up the rest of the night to write a 8-10 page research paper for my University, so what can I say? Yet as an athlete and the brother of a diabetic, I can truly say that these Monster Energy drinks are horrible for you. However, they are an addiction. Some smoke others gamble but I choose to drink Monster. It is the only energy drink I enjoy and I will most likely keep it that way.	0	1

		A1G78GAMWL1AOL	Great--for two days	My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy.  He chewed the rope apart in one day.  Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball.  It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats.  Kept the pup occupied for two hours.  Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats.  the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.<br /><br />This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher.  the design is great, especially with the ball addition.	0	1

		A28TJZ9VPMMUNZ	Good, rich flavor	I had been buying Trader Joe's Grade B for about the same price.  TJ is kind of a drive so I used the prime and this is far superior.

		A3EUSH8DPW75LR	Great coffee when the price is right	I love my coffee and have tried all the name brands as well as some generic.  I always come back to Folgers Classic Roast.  It is the perfect medium blend and the taste is rich, suberb and totally satisfying.  Great for the morning pick me up or any other time of day.  But coffee is getting expensive.  The large containers of all brands used to come in 39 oz sizes.  Then they went down to 33 ounces for the same price.  Now many are going down to this new 22 ounce size.  I am amazed in the stores at the high price of coffee now.  This Folgers coffee here on Amazon is an amazing deal for price and quality of coffee when you use subscribe and save.  You get three canisters, a total of 66 ounces, for $19.49.  It comes out even cheaper to what two 33 ounce used to cost in the store.  And my local store just had this 22 ounce size on sale for $8.99. For 3 that's $8 more than this great Amazon deal.<br /><br />This review is definitely about the superb Folgers coffee though.  I must add that I also find the 22 ounce size very user friendly for the coffee stays fresh longer due to the smaller size.  Same amount of coffee in 3 canisters rather than 2 for the same price.  But as always there are some sellers on here trying to rip the buyer off when Amazon is out of stock.  No coffee is worth the ridiculous prices some will charge.  $47 for this?  Be real.  Just be certain to purchase it from the ever reliable Amazon themselves and you will be getting the best coffee out there at an unbeatable price.  Love Folgers and Amazon.	11	0
		A381ASYWITO01W	horrible	I am the biggest fan of mushrooms you'll ever meet, but these are really disgusting. They taste like dirt.

		A1XM65S80UQ2MD	Great Natural Energy	This is a fantastic product, and I wish it was readily available in most stores. It's taste is not the greatest, but it's a 2.5 oz. shot, and it's gone in a second. It tastes, more or less, like a concentrated sweet tea. For the record, I've had 5 hour energy, and that tastes FAR worse. I will put up the taste for the results. It's got 150mg of caffeine, which is the equivalent of the big red bulls and monsters. I can't stand sucralose and sugar substitutes, and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it. The sugar is at 9g, which isn't horrible. I used to drink 4 16oz. Red Bulls a day for the caffeine, and this gives me far better energy, and is much more subtle. My preference is black coffee, but I can't drink 8-12 cups a day anymore. Overall, Steaz does it right; real organic ingredients in moderate amounts, and they create big results.	13	0

		A3NXBP212KFH5X	Like Spice? Get these	These are the best spicy chips I have ever had the pleasure of eating.  They start off sweet, then as you eat more the spice builds up.  They are fantastic.  If you don't want to commit to a whole case, pick up a bag at your local Whole Foods first, then stock up here when you realize how amazing they are.  Got my case right here, and loving every bite.  On a side note, this brand (Kettle Brand) has many delicious varieties- this is just my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend: Backyard BBQ, Honey Dijon, Sweet Onion, Buffalo Bleu, Salt and Pepper and Death Valley Chipotle.  Lays aint got nothin on Kettle Brand!!!	1	0
		A1Y4NQ8TL8DY0N	Not exactly what I expected	"The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Overall the taste wasn't what I expected - it was kinda yucky/pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not ""terrible"" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.<br /><br />I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit."	1	1
		A3N94EX7EQNWWN	Perfect for me!	Fresh potatoes go bad on me, since i live alone, so these Libby's canned potatoes are perfect for me.

		A29JUMRL1US6YP	Great Low Calorie Training Treats	"Charlee Bears are small and low calorie, so you can use them en masse for training.  We use them both for standard training (sit, stay, drop it, leave it) and behavioral training (no bark).  They're not stinky or messy, so you can put them in your pocket, purse, or car without worry.  We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."	0	1

My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice.	17	1
		A22APGMHINBQ25	The only tea for iced tea!	I grew up drinking Lipton loose leaf tea and didn't even realize there was any other for iced tea until I grew up and left home. It's still the best! I almost panicked when the stores quit carrying it and was so relieved to find it here. I hope Amazon reads these reviews and realizes that we *need* them to keep carrying it! And that Lipton keeps on making it. Everyone likes my iced tea and says so and that's because this is the only tea I use.	1	0

		A39ZMQO5K0BG6U	K Cups are Reasonably Adequate	For product to work properly (IMHO) you need coffee ground as fine as possible. Once filter has been inserted, plave carefully leveled measure of coffee in it. Manuever lid into place, then press down on center-STEADILY- w/ thumb.<br /><br />Plan to use no more than 6 Oz. of water for your cup.<br /><br />Removal of used cup from machine is occasional problem.

Excellent flavor (purchased the hickory, trying original next), and an awesome price for such large qauntity.  It's nice to see actual texture and strip size variations, vs. the new ""pressed square beef-like product"" now being sold as jerky in many bags.<br /><br />My fiance mentioned upon trying her first piece that it doesn't taste like store-bought.  I recommend this if you're a jerky fanatic struggling to find a good price/quality ratio!"	1	1
		A79XDKI3P4VN9	The Cat's Meow	All four of my cats loved this canned cat food!  The food in each can really looked and smelled as if a human being could eat the food.<br /><br />The seasame chicken entree and chicken pot pie entree were both very popular with my cats.  Neither flavor smelled bad.  The chicken pot pie entree was kind of runny, but my cats really enjoyed lapping up the juice.  I've feed my cats a few cans of each flavor, and none of them have got the diarrhea from the food.  Their stomachs seem to tolerate the food quite well.  I've had probelms in the past with canned cat food causing stomach and other digestive problems for my cats.<br /><br />According to the can's list of ingredients, all the ingredients are natural - no by-products are used.  While the food is not organic, at least the food doesn't use by-products.  No wheat gluten is used either.<br />I went to the company's website and found that the company uses only dolphin safe tuna and does not use any child labor.  None of the ingredients come from China, which has a horrible record on food safety.  The cat food is made in  Thailand, but as far as I know, Thailand does not have a poor record of food safety, and Thai people do love their pet cats, I sure Thai pet owners would not want to harm their cats with poor quality pet food.  I personally see nothing to fear from Thai cat food.<br /><br />I think I will be ordering more Petite Cusine in the future and would not hestitate recommending this food to my cat loving friends.	1	0

		AU5NR5QBB0BIP	Very flavorful albeit a light roast	This was my first experience with a kona blend and it was a very pleasant and tasteful coffee. It was sweet, with somewhat of floral undertones, with a wonderful aftertaste. All in all a very good coffee.<br /><br />One caveat for those who like full bodied and/or darker roasts: this comes accross to me as a light roast (although is labeled as a medium roast). To be honest it did take away from the experience a little for me as I prefer medium roasts, but I still give it a five star rating because of the quality of the flavor.	1	0
		AXBAI06TPXYUJ	Chocolate Belgian Waffles	The Chocolate Belgian Waffle mix was everything it was advertised as, we enjoyed the waffles, they light airy and not as sweet as one would expect, will buy this product again, there are no chips in the mix you may want to add a few white or dark chips if you have a sweet tooth.	0	0
		ARR2EMPJ2SFLK	The best kept secret - not really	I have been using Luzianne Cajun Seasonings for years.  I find it best on Beef and fish/seafood.  Like one of the other reviewers, I like the fineness and the blend of the seasoning.  The combination of the two gives it it's unique flavor.<br /><br />When I have friends and family over for steaks, they always say these are the best, what's your secret.  I first tell them it's an old family secret, but then I tell them about Luzianne.  I am not sure they are listning, because the next time over we have to go through the same conversation.  Oh well, more praise for me!<br /><br />Thanks Luzianne for all the pats on the back.	0	0

My son loves Maple Brown Sugar Cream of Wheat so when I was offered to try the Quaker Maple Brown Sugar Oatmeal I jumped at the chance to offer him something different.  It was a huge hit!  It was super easy to prepare.  I put the oatmeal in a bowl with 2/3 cup of milk (he won't drink milk so this is one of the only ways we get it into him) and put it in the microwave for one minute and he ate it up almost as quick as it was made!<br /><br />Great price for this box of instant oatmeal too - if you do the subscribe and save you can save even more and cancel or change your shipment at anytime!	0	0
		AG7QPDO7GNT5B	Taste good but gave me gas =(	These little taffy's are expensive. I think I paid around $11 for the pound. They taste good, but man do they give me gas. After eating about 3 my stomach would be rumbling for a few hours and I would have to pass gas a lot. My girlfriend wouldn't let me eat them before bed hahaha.

		A2DMS4Y2JQMR8P	This is the first oatmeal I ever really liked!!!!!	I know how healthy oatmeal is supposed to be for you, but I have never found a brand with a flavor much less a texture that I could ever tolerate. No matter how much I doctored it up, it was still slimy stuff with pieces of other stuff in it.<br />  I thought I would give it one more try, and lo and behold, this is the best oatmeal I have EVER EATEN in my ENTIRE LIFE. And I am in my 60's!!!! If you have ever had an aversion to oatmeal as I have, you WILL be able to eat this oatmeal.  Perhaps it is the mixture of the barley and dried fruit that does it.<br />  My first cup I tried straight up, and it was sweet and delightful.  Next cup I tried adding some brown sugar, but you know, I think it was a bit too sweet, and I decided it was just fine all on its own.<br />  The portion is large and very filling, it makes a satisfying breakfast.<br />Bottom line, I am hooked for life on this stuff.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed. 8-)	0	0
		A1USXD2XVPP9WD	Just The Best	"I just love this coffee. It is very complex in tastes. I got a few through a trade and kept putting off ordering it. I would say it is a light/medium roast. I really hate dark chocolate but in this coffee it is amazing. The raspberry and dark chocolate are ""true"" in taste. I use sugar and cream/creamer and it is like a dessert without the calories. I don't want to be without it in my cupboard. Which is why I wish it were on subscribe and save program here on Amazon (hint)."	1	0
		A1RKCPYOCFTE0Y	Great food	"I feed my dogs Sojos as part of a mixed bowl of quality kibble and quality canned food.  I recommend Sojos.<br /><br />But I had a problem with the Amazon purchase.  Amazon stored the Sojos bag in the original mailing box Sojos sent them.  My order was picked from the shelf and the box containing the Sojos was placed in another box and mailed to me.  The bag of Sojos was almost one year old and there was no way Amazon kept track of that.  I got a refund from Amazon with no question and very quickly, but Amazon needs to keep control of the ""use-by"" dates of food they offer on their site."	8	0
		A246YIFE5M6M2C	My Favorite Switch Drink So Far, But I Haven't Tried the Grape Yet	My first impression on this particular drink when I first tasted it was that it reminded me of nothing that I had every tasted before. I actually really liked the taste of it. Unlike your typical sodas, this drink did not have the lingering carbonated fizz and I didn't get any disgusting soda burps after drinking it. You know the kind I mean, when you burp and anyone within 20 or 30 yards of you is running for fresh air. I also didn't get any real aftertaste when drinking it either.<br /><br />Now coming in at 8.3 ounces, the calories in this drink are reported at 135 calories per can. By comparison, a 12 ounce can of Pepsi comes in at 150 calories per can. So, on the calorie front I wouldn't say that there is much of a difference between this drink and Pepsi, although if you do the math, this drink would actually have more calories than Pepsi if you compared them in equal amounts. However, if you look at the list of ingredients in both, you can see where this product is far better for you than your traditional sodas, although obviously not as good for you as drinking an actual 100% pure fruit or vegetable juice.<br /><br />To put in plainly and succinctly, this is a really good tasting beverage and is definitely one I would consider drinking over the more traditional sodas that are currently available. However, the one primary detractor to this is the size of the can compared to the price.<br /><br />The one thing that I had not quite decided on whether it is a negative or a positive is the size of the can, which as I stated earlier comes in at 8.3 ounces compared to your traditional cans of soda that come in at 12 ounces. In addition to the size of the can, there is also the consideration of price, coming in at roughly $1.00 per can which is considerably more expensive than your average can of soda. Therefore, when you take the size of the product combined with the price, I would have to say that it is a definite negative, although this one tasted so good to me that I will definitely be purchasing this product.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Creator of numerous books and DVD's.	0	0
		A1OKSCYVZRDNU8	Wonderful aroma!	When I opened the package a wonderful aroma was greeting me! This was the first time I experimented with Szechuan Peppercorns. They are not really peppercorns but husks. You have to dry roast them for a few minutes then grind them. I used them in a oil based marinade for my chicken dish...very yummy and pleasantly unusual. Delivery was fast and the peppercorns appear to be super fresh.	2	0
		A2XGVBSTZXCMZ9	Great taste, less sodium	The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet.	0	0
		A11GAMN6HED4U1	So VERY Bad	If you like the taste of water with a hint of coffee, buy this. Otherwise stick with Starbucks VIA.<br />I use the instant coffee mid-way through my day at work. The Taster's Choice requires 3 packs to make a decent 16oz cup of coffee. The Starbucks VIA only needs 1. Spend the extra couple of dollars on the Starbucks if you want good instant coffee.	0	2
		A3B2K6SNKNJKJN	Lipton Loose Leaf Tea	"Fewer and fewer stores carry loose-leaf tea and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. Who knew?  I've become an avid fan of Amazon over the last few months.

		A15USNEAJUXOSH	Delicious	I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor.	0	0
		ANYYRCZ3I9GZ4	Awesome at a price	I was lucky enough to travel to Oz last November and filled half a suitcase with Aussie junk food (not the best thing for a diabetic, but you only live once!).<br /><br />Anyway, Cherry Ripe(s) are incredible, with a cherry taste and a texture similar to a Mounds bar. Of course, we don't get these in the States. Why? Who knows? I couldn't find any Diet Dr. Pepper or Diet A&W Root Beer to save my life over there, so it may be a cultural thing.<br /><br />The price seems pretty steep for a candy bar, so you might see if you have any candy specialty shops (even ones that are labeled as being British) where you live before ordering. I know I could find 'American' candy over there, but you pay a hefty price for it.	1	0

She loves it and ever after the beagle has tried to destroy it you can hardly see a mark on it!  At least as far as dogs are concerned I think this might be indestructible.	0	0
		A4I2IZR54W9FT	Best Ketchup around	This has to be the best ketchup I have ever tasted!<br /><br />Although it is more expensive that other ketchup brands it does raise the bar for the various brands that we all have been eating for years.<br />This ketchup is thick and taste great for a bottled product that is processed it holds up excellent.<br /><br />I am now a believer in the Organicville brands.	1	0
		A1T1BT6B345Y6E	Great, high-quality cat food	I've tried a number of high-quality canned cat foods to supplement the dry food my cats always have available to them, and these appear to be the best as judged by me and the cats.  For one thing, these actually look like fish.  You open the can, and there are large pieces of actual fish in the can, instead of the weird, mystery paste.  It pretty much smells like you've opened a can of real fish, too (not in a bad way, though I don't share my cats' love of sardines.)<br /><br />One of my two cats is a picky eater when it comes to canned food.  I picked up a can of each of the varieties from the local pet store when I wanted to try switching to Tiki Cat, and learned that the picky one will only eat the varieties that include sardines.  There are a few different sardine varieties, so at least it forces her to have some variety in her diet in case they stop producing one of them.<br /><br />The picky one has always been very excited about getting her daily quota of canned food, but the other cat seems way more excited about dinner time since we switched to Tiki Cat, so I take that as her endorsement of this positive review.	3	0
		A12J61DPL4H7H9	Best popcorn I've ever had at home!	I purchased this popcorn for my Nostalgia retro popcorn machine hoping that I would be able to produce movie theatre quality popcorn at home.  The seller describes this as the best popcorn available and I have to agree that it really lives up to the hype!  The popcorn comes out delicious every time-- the perfect balance of butteriness and salt.  I tried using popcorn kernels and all kinds of different oils before I bought this product.  I will never use anything other than this popcorn!  The only problem is that I have eaten 10 of 24 packages-- and I've only had it for two weeks!	0	0
		A36WTXJBYS3DB6	Tasty discovery!	I found this package of red quinoa at a local health food store. I'd never bought quinoa before, so I thought it was a little expensive. But now that I've taken a trip to another natural food store -- the kind that carries food in bulk -- I realize it's the going rate.<br /><br />That said, I really love this red quinoa. The Eden Organic brand is much more tasty than the more expensive kind that I got at the bulk health food store. After having regular quinoa at a picnic last week, I must say that both of the brands of red quinoa have more flavor and interest than regular quinoa.<br /><br />I have two all-time favorite recipes now, one that mixes the quinoa with craisins, sunflower seeds, feta cheese, scallions and cilatro with a mustard vinaigrette (my own recipe). The other salad (on the Wegmans website) mixes the red quinoa with avocado, corn, tomatoes, scallions and cilantro in a lemon vinaigrette.	5	0
		A2KYPW9FX7BZJR	Great Sauce	This sauce has one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  There's a good balance between spice and garlic.  It has decent heat and tastes good on a lot of things.  I'm not a big fan of most Habanero sauces due to the extra bitterness of the pepper but this sauce blends everything perfectly.	1	0

		A281NPSIMI1C2R	Intoxicating	The minute you open a bag of Melitta Riviera Sunset you will think you are in Starbucks. The rich aroma is intoxicating, a promise of things to come. I like my coffee a little stronger so I used a  cup ground coffee with 12-ounces water. After brewing the coffee my entire apartment was heavenly scented with a superior fragrance. The first sip was like falling in love. I literally felt heady. The only thing I added was a little half & half and two packets of stevia. I would highly recommend that you have this coffee after dinner with your dessert. This is truly an exceptional coffee! I'm beyond impressed. Now I'm eager to try the Melitta's Parisian Vanilla ground coffee.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review	0	3

		A2T05B6AEI59N4	Made my dog SICK	"My boxer enjoyed the treat, though after eating it she drank a bowl full of water.  Maybe it had a lot of sodium.  The real surprise came the next day though when she suffered a loss of bowel control; she's never went #2 in the house since we got her over a year ago.  Afterwards, we took her on a hike and she couldn't seem to stop ""going"", had 7 bowel movements on a 2 mile hike; and they were very watery.  She's still not acting back to her normal self.  I guess it makes sense; I wouldn't trust a butcher from a group of people whom I know to be cannibals, why should I trust dog treats made in countries that eat dogs?"	1	1
		A5XWTUJYPLJXH	love it...should be in every kitchen..so much flavor!	do you love tomatoes? This is like a super concentration of tomato flavor that you can add to anything. Like a meaty flavor in a beef stew, add this! Look it up, tomato paste / powder brings out the meaty flavor in beef. We add it to omelettes, crock pot beef dishes, kale chips... it works well in many recipes...and it never goes bad like a store bought tomato. Best of all....the price. Have you seen the price of tomato paste? This is how they make it... and you skip the middle man. makes me smile, how about you?	0	0

		A24X6593QVUZ4E	Run...Don't Walk to Purchase Lucy's Cookies	As a relative of a child with severe food allergies, i have always struggled with what to serve when the child comes to visit.  Until i heard of (then tasted) these gems! Not only are they super safe for children (or anyone) with food allergies, they are delicious.  I find myself purchasing some just when i get a cookie craving.  they are hands down the best line of cookies I have ever had....Great flavor (you would NEVER know that these were produced with safe products rather than traditional cookie ingredients).  I think one of the hardest thing for parents and relatives and friends of people with allergies is finding GOOD, tasty foods...especially sweets.  If you have a loved one with a food allergy, i think you should stock these in your pantry (but beware, you will find yourself craving them as well!!!)	1	1
		A1CYGRMV5RB006	Doggy Prison Food	I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.

Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce.	1	3

		AKR4DH6WLF6GG	"""juice, bubbles and Vitamin C"""	"The product description says it's ""just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C."" Doesn't that sound good? I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.<br /><br />The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.<br /><br />The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.<br /><br />I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. You'll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009"	0	0

		A39TSOBXL6M2Z4	lame, big disappointment...	I ran out of mate, and have been drinking mate for a long time. I ended up picking this up at the local Co-op. Well I gotta say this tastes horrible. I have been drinking mate for a long time as I lived in Argentina, and this tastes nothing like normal mate. I understand the idea behind this mate, and the better health reasons behind having it unsmoked and organic, which organic and unsmoked sounds like an amazing idea, especially since I prefer organic everything! The problem is that this mate tastes nothing like normal mate, and really doesn't have a good taste. There are a lot of Americans who when they drink mate out of a gourd and bombilla who think that it tastes like dirt. Well this mate is definitely a dirt earthy taste. It tastes nothing like a good crop of mate, this is highly agreed by my Argentinian friend who ended up throwing his purchase in the garbage just after 2 gourds full, and eventually I tried to struggle through this yerba, but in the end it was just too much for me. Waste of money, and the many Argentinians that are friends of the family want to stay away from this mate, when even they would prefer to drink organic as well. Sorry eco teas, but your crafty wording, and healthy image doesn't always mean it is good. I mean just because you have a pretty label, and you take out all the stalk from your teas does not mean they are truly better. The stalk is fundamentally part of yerba mate, as an image and why waste the other part of the plant right? For an alternative to smoked mate and non organic there are better ones out there....	6	3

		A36O1VMDFDD3VW	Bring Back Verona	As a perusal of comment about Verona Dark will show, the fans of regular Verona are terribly disappointed that their favorite coffee is being discontinued. It's your company and you can run it any way you please. Conclusion: Unless there is a specific reason to discontinue regular Verona, the decision to do so is (for me terribly) ill-advised.<br /><br />There. How's that for potentially positive and useful feedback?<br /><br />PS: I cannot choose the product you want me to specify, because you mention only DARK Verona.	0	0

		A1BRIY5SDHY793	A sigh of relief	My child was re-diagnosed with a gluten allergy a few months ago.  I had went through changing his diet when he was an infant/toddler, but I knew that doing it again as a six year old was going to be more difficult.  It is important to note that my child also has Aspergers; so change for him has been difficult.<br />I, like any other mother, frantically searched to find foods that my child could and would eat.  I am embarrassed to tell you how much I spent on breads alone.  I couldn't find any that he would eat. After resolving that we just wouldn't eat anything similar to bread, I stumbled on this mix in a different health food store.  I have been familiar with Pamela's products and recommend their products to anyone who hasn't tried them.  I was amazed by the outcome.  This bread has great texture, looks like the real deal, and a taste that rallies the real deal as well.  Amazon.com also has the best price if you use its free super saver shipping.  HIghly recommend	0	0
		A3R7R8ARVN2P3D	Outstanding Food for both healthy and sick cats	"I first switched to this food for my senior cats who both had cancer (most likely from my feeding them cheap food all their lives - never again). Within days of starting my cancer-cats on this food they both perked up, gained weight, and actually maintained the last few months of their lives in an active and normal manner. Both of course finally succumbed to cancer, but even the vet was surprised at how long they lived after diagnosis, and how brief the period of their final decline was (they both sort of bottomed out within a two day period at the end).<br /><br />Now, the other piece: I had purchased another Siamese upon learning of my other cats' illness, and he not only loved them, he also loved the Natural Balance food, which was all he got. I noticed that as he grew he was not anemic looking as most siamese are, but actually had good muscle tone. When I brought him for his first vet checkup the vet said, and I quote ""In 20 years, this is the healthiest looking Siamese cat I have ever seen."" She commented on his physique, muscle tone, activity level, coat, etc. I later adopted a Tabby the same age as the Siamese, and got the same response. Both cats just have sleek, beautiful coats, are very athletic and energetic, and love the Natural Balance food.<br /><br />I firmly believe that this food (and I now also use Blue Buffalo Wilderness for some variety) has made a real and noticeable differnce in the health and quality of life of my cats, and I highly recommend it to anyone. I will say my cats don't care for the wet Natural Balance foods, so I supplement their diet with an occasional Fancy Feast flavor that is free of glutens and fillers (you can Google for the list. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Addendum 4/12/10: My cats have changed their minds about the NB wet food and really enjoy it now. The key is to switch around the flavors.<br /><br />Addendum 4/22/11: have since adopted two more shelter cats, one a snowshoe siamese, the other a sable burmese. After each being on Natural Balance for about five months, the Snowshoe has a fur coat that is silky and beautiful; the little Burmese has a sleek shiny coat. Both have loads of energy. Again the vet was amazed at their coats and muscle tone, as was the vet tech."	15	0

		A343AFAT1JZQTY	Sure puts the chalk in chalkolate	Sure to be a hit with chalk-a-holics everywhere, from first sip to last this product suggests its European heritage deep in the chalk mines of southern France.<br /><br />Some seem to be making a case for it only having 60 calories, but the Keurig Chai Latte only has 70, and that product actually tastes pretty good.<br /><br />I have yet to find a Keurig-compatible hot chocolate that stands up to plain old Swiss Miss, scooped from a tub or a foil packet. And Swiss Miss isn't that great to begin with, although it sure is cheaper than this stuff.<br /><br />I wonder if the size of the Keurig capsule limits the amount of cocoa and powdered milk that can be put into a cup, so what ends up there has to be strong and highly compromised.	0	0

		A1JXDNYYEAABFO	Not as good as the Newman's Own Mints in the tins	I really enjoy all the flavors of Newman's Own Mints, and I thought I would try the rolls for a change.  Yes, the rolls are less expensive, but they do not have the same consistency or mouth feel as the mints of the same flavor that are sold in tins.  Also, the mints in tins do seem to last longer, so I wonder if these rolls (though convenient) are even a better bargain.  I would not purchase these again; rather, I will spring for a few extra dollars and continue to purchase the Newman's Own Mints in tins.	0	0

		A2UDUJG17I8S1	Greatest stuff on the planet	"This is the greatest stuff on the planet. First off, I think it's the best silken tofu there is--firm silken will do all of your silken needs, basically. I use it to make mousses for desserts in my food processor. For instance, add some melted chocolate chips, some corn starch, add to a graham cracker crust: you've got a pie. Or I will add some peanut butter, cocoa powder and maple syrup to make a mousse. I also like to just add strawberries and bananas and maple syrup for a ""yogurt."" I use it to make ""sour cream"" and onion dips for vegetables. I also like it to make ""sour cream"" for Mexican food and potatoes--my omni boyfriend can't even tell the difference. Also good to make mayonnaise for potato salad. I recommend a food processor or blender to really get the smooth, creamy texture. This tofu is the best stuff on the planet. I order the 12 pack of it, because I got through 4 or more a week. Also, I like to get the organic, because soybeans are typically highly sprayed crops. It's worth the few extra bucks. I love this stuff--behind my almond milk, this is my most vital ingredient."	17	1

I eat mine with fresh blueberries and bananas, sometimes I add raspberries, blackberries, or strawberries as well.<br /><br />This price is crazy. Perhaps it is a matter of having to pay all that commision to amazon that is making it difficult to be competitive on grocery type merchandise.<br /><br />They actually want me to pay 50 bucks for 7 boxes when I can often find it at 2 for 5.oo at wegmans, which would be 20 bucks for 8 boxes? ? ?<br /><br />Its outragious!	2	1

I discovered it while at a pei wei someone had left a bottle of this laying out and I quick snapped a picture, took it to amazon and found it. It is great on pretty much everything, as previous users say.  I was also in a Thai restaurant the other night and they used the same sauce on an amazing salad.  Try this on a do it yourself salad consisting of sliced mangos, lettuce, onions, and red peppers.  Drench those ingredients in this stuff and everyone will think your a master chef.	0	0

		A360OAQUH18QAJ	Lovely Treat - Not Too Sweet!	These cookies are our favorite summer treat - we keep them in the freezer so they get a cool soft crunch. They are sweet in that european way, so your teeth don't hurt when you eat them! I am a health conscious sugar addict (a tough combo!) and these fit the bill just right when I cannot bake my own desserts. We love the fresh lemony flavor after a meal, or as a mid-afternoon snack.<br /><br />If you like very sugary sweets, you probably won't like these. However,  if you want to wean yourself (or your kids!) off of a lot of white sugar intake, you might want to give these a try! A pack of 12 goes faster than you think...	7	0

		A3OFZFLLURJNVZ	It's a party in my mouth!	I ordered these not knowing how good or bad they really were. They are amazing, incredible, delicious, and pretty good as well. The amaretto is injected by needle into two distinct bands that run the length of the cake, so the distribution is even and balanced. The cake itself is very good, reminiscent of a handmade pound cake of many years ago, before that horrible mess the grocery stores sell as 'pound cake' became the norm. Excellent flavor, texture, and moistness. Recommended without hesitation, UNLESS you are on a diet, in which case ordering this is akin to total surrender.	1	0
		A42YG78Z1GBBD	Love Green Mountain Breakfast Blend -- Great Coffee!!!!!	I just recently got my Keurig, and I've been trying the sample pack of coffee that came with it.  So far this is by far my favorite.  I nice mild coffee taste to enjoy in the morning or anytime.  I actually wish they made this coffee in a decaf version also so I could enjoy the great flavor of this one anytime!  I think this will be the main coffee in this house; I've tried some of the others and liked some of them more than others, but this is the runaway favorite.  I tend to put a good bit of cream and sugar in my coffee (can't stand it black!) but the nice flavor of this one comes through the cream and sugar.  (I've found that cream and sugar can't cover up the taste of coffee I don't like!)  I don't care for the bolder coffees at all (I don't feel like getting slapped in the face by my coffee in the morning!)<br /><br />I'd encourage everyone to give this a try if you like a light roast coffee with a mild, pleasant taste in the morning -- you won't be disappointed!!!	1	0

		A3GIO61J5X9065	Healthy, cat friendly food.	My cats like this food a lot.  I am happy to give it to them because it seems to be very healthy for them.  I feed them the dry Natural Balance along with the canned which they are crazy about.  With this combination their coats are shinier and even their muscle structure is tighter and they look healthier and are doing very well.  Some former foods that I used left them always hungry.  With Natural Balance they are much more content.  As far as the cost is concerned,  I actually save money.  The food lasts longer because they eat less.  I have read this is  because they need less to meet their nutritional needs.  This does seem to be the case.  I recommend Natural Balance highly.	0	0

		A1IZIRZ0JQE6NZ	Fantastic!	Bigelow Vanilla Caramel tea is the most delicious tea I have ever tasted. I  use Silk soy creamer with the tea to add an extra vanilla taste.

		A30ELDPP5TCQ8J	WAY better than I expected	The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself.	0	2

I have never fed more then 10-12 at a time!<br /><br />At home I have adopted a persian and I often use the hairball treatments with her and they actually DO WORK!!!!! I give her the suggested doce of 10 treats at a time and they are very tasty. Since, I have never seen her gag from hairballs, not once!<br /><br />All of my cats come running when I open these treats. My favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain I also love to feed them. They love them all!<br /><br />The ONLY other treats I feed usually are Pounce and Party Mix but Temptations are there favortires!<br /><br />I HAVE ABOUT 8 BAGS OF THESE IN MY CABINETS... Because I have a lot of treats!<br /><br />At the shelter I run, we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and NONE have never had any problems with these treats to date. I am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available. I also love that they provide GREAT dental care and tarter control.<br /><br />Providing these treats I honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely LOVE!!!!<br /><br />My mom and I pay the vet bills for any sick cats, we love cats!!! So far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or Leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested.<br /><br />Please give these treats a try, they are awesome! Oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags.. You get about 3x the ammount!	4	1

		A2HS6ND7J8IQ0L	Not the same as the canned version	"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."	2	1

		A3K3SE4RK846WO	Love Newman's Products	My dog really enjoyed these snacks.  She has Kidney problems so I am warry of giving her any old treats.  I trust the Newman brand and have faith that they don't put fillers (such as wood chips or other low quality ingredients) into their products.  Let's face it, our dogs are part of our families and we should feed them high quality foods and snacks.  These are on the larger side - I prefer smaller treats for my dog because she is overweight.  Overall a great quality - check the ingredients listed in case your dog has any allergies.	1	1
		A2BCB516A8HV6K	amazing	Take 5 are my favorite candy bar.  The perfect mix of salty and sweet.  This package is a good value, giving you six packs of snack-size bars, which probably contain about 20 individual bars in each (I should've counted before I ate them all, whoops!).	0	0
		A1QGQ6BDB5PR2X	Love this product	"Just be forewarned it is a bit ""moist.""  Have plenty of papertowels/napkins around when eating it.<br /><br />However for vegan jerky, this has by far the best texture. You will be picking it out of your teeth for hours! And for me, that is a good thing!<br /><br />My fav is the BBQ flavor, however their other flavors are very tasty as well :-)"	1	0
		A14TL45CP14SUX	Corgi Owners Beware	I purchased this toy for my four month old corgi; she absolutely loves it. The only problem is she figured out how to get the bottom off (where humans fill to bottle) before she figured out how to use it as designed. So, if you have a corgi or any extremely bright dog, you may want to consider gluing the bottom shut and taking a more difficult approach of filling with treats via the top.	0	0
		A3P5V207OED3JS	Dogs go crazy for this	As another reviewer noted...This is like crack for dogs! My dog likes jerky but loves freeze dried liver. The tub may be a but much but is the best value.	0	0
		A3IQ9MP118YTIU	deliciously addictive	best candy I know of.... like tasting a glass of pink grapefruit juice--  but lasts longer!	0	0
		AT9Z378V18UFF	Yum	This powdered peanut butter is yum.  I like to add it to my morning low fat/cal shake. I would definitely order again!	0	0
		A2RB1UIF3W1G8C	Great Coffee !	I drink alot of coffee and love hazelnut coffee, this brand has the best flavor I have ever tasted. I have bought several different brands and this one is the BEST! It may be a few dollars more but it is worth it. I absolutely love and enjoy it every morning.	0	0
		A1E517P7IR19RH	Sweet Potato PopChips are Sweeeeet!	I think Sweet potato is the best flavor that Popchips offers.  They have the lowest sodium without sacrificing taste.  Not only do I love them, but my son loves them.  And he is hard to please.  Very healthy alternative to fried chips.	1	0
		A1HR52VI4R6WIY	Excellent Treat	These are excellent and healthy training high value treats.  My dogs love them.  They are good to handle after hydrating.  I like they come in various versions.	0	0
		A39OSL9YIIROA7	Delicious!	They have this coffee at where I work... and before this, they had this horrible folgers coffee which HAD to be diluted with sweetner and creamer... I can actually drink this black because it's actually good! It tastes like a coffee that was brewed from a cafe, not just your coffee machine at home. Good stuff.	0	0
		A3O7W6JNQF4Q7E	Glutino products are consistantly great.	"We have been a gluten free family for 17 years.  At first the GF products available in our local store in no way resembled the foods we were comfortable with.  If it was a baked good I baked it at home, there was no reasonable option especially for crackers.  A few years ago we discovered Glutino products.  The brand is consistently great.  I know if I am buying a Glutino product my family will love it. I love the convenience and value of ""subscribe and save"".  The Glutino GF original crackers arrive at our door almost effortlessly.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CWV4PA"">Glutino Gluten Free Original Crackers, 4.4 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>  My family packs them in lunch boxes and snacks on the crackers happily because they taste great."	0	0
		A1Z86GS9B9DPB2	the best for less	I bought this coffee for my mom, which is getting harder to find where we live. She says this is her favorite by far, the smell and taste you can't beat. Cheaper to buy on here than store, which only has a couple at a time. This is a year supply for her.	1	0
		A2HZFCI50VR99A	Too dry and sharp	I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves.	1	1
		A3P1GFZYSIDK23	Delicious, and easy to make healthier	"These are very good, and so easy!  Plus, I never fail to be impressed at how CHOCK-FULL they are of chocolate chunks.  No skimping here.  I order it through Amazon's ""Subscribe and Save"" program, which makes these a very good deal indeed.  What makes these cookies an even BETTER deal is that you can make them healthier by substituting ingredients.  This mix calls for one egg and 1 stick of butter.  Instead, I use the egg and a generous 1/4 c. peanut butter plus a generous 1/4 c. plain yogurt (and a bit of water as-needed for consistency).  No butter necessary.  They still come out good, and I feel even better about them.  Eat & ENJOY!"	2	0
		A27X750TSCLBD	YUMMY if you can cook	I LOVE these noodles.  You HAVE to cook them right, drain and rinse or they WON'T be tasty.  I drain them and rinse until very little scent of soy is left then add to HOT pan with a little coconut oil. I add garlic, onion, red pepper flakes and a little salt and cook for a while then i eat em like ramen with a slice of cheese .  Very good diet food.	2	0
		AV56YWTHDJ42I	fantastic mix of Popchip goodness	We love Popchips, but they're hard to find at our local grocery stores. I was very excited to find this variety pack, which has 6 flavors (some of which we'd never tried before) in single-serve packages right around 100 calories a piece. Our favorites were the original, sea salt & vinegar, and sour cream & onion... but all of the flavors were good. These were perfect for snacks, but they also made for easy lunches. We'll definitely order again!	0	1
		A1S27P7KJO9I96	Good dog treat	What can a person say about a dog treat?  My yellow lab loves these treats, and I like that they are an organic product.  I also like that Newmans Own donates to charity.  If these are important to you, I recommend the treats.	0	0
		ALAN629D6EKQZ	Taste real good and Fresh	The popcorn is very good.  Very fresh. More salt than I like, but able to separate it fairly easy. This was a good value for the money.  I am able to add my own popcorn to the mix to make more.  Next time it is on sale I'll buy some more, glad that I bought two case when I had the chance.  Also it was ship and receive very fast.	0	0
		AIMENKO3TMZ4X	TERRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT	"I wish I could say that the new Bonomo Turkish Taffy was ""only a shadow of the original"". That'd be good. But, in fact, it's much, much worse than that. The new taffy has none of the full, rich flavor of the original product. Instead, it fills your palate with intensely and unpleasantly artificial flavors, and little else. Probably, manufacturing the candy using the original ingredients in their original proportions proved far to expensive. Unless the makers of the new taffy change their product to adhere to the original, I'd say don't waste your time or money on what presently amounts to a hoax."	3	0

		A1TRAEV7QWA5DX	Another favorite	We eat lots of oatmeal and this is one of our favorites.  It is a simple meal to fix if you are in a hurry any time of the day.  Would recommend purchasing.	0	1

		A12GW9PRYQS911	Obsessed!	I'm a young adult staying in shape, going to the gym, and eating healthy. I don't stop myself from having a big spoon a day of Simon Fischer's Lekvar Prune Butter, replacing all the tempted junk food around the house or the isles at your local convenient store. It actually replaces my Dark Chocolate addiction too. Prune Butter is used for many snacks, but I like it just the way it is. And its not only for Grandma's and Grandpa's!!	2	0
		A24YL8QMC0DKNF	Great Product	This product is great for pancakes. For baked goods I blend Bisquick (2/3 part) with Pamela's bread mix (1/3 part) for great gluten-free/dairy-free treats. The bread mix makes it less crumbly.	0	0
		AXW3NFHP4ICNH	Can't get enough	I first found these at a local deli but they freqently were out of stock so I was thrilled to find them on Amazon. These are very satisfying and I have great fun introducing friends and co-workers to them.<br /><br />I also frequently recommend them to people with sore throats or coughs. Honey is an antibacterial agent and very soothing so these make an excellent lozenge in addition to being a wonderful candy.<br /><br />I bought a case so I can hand them out to people having a bad day. :)	3	1
		A2VJGR6UAQTG46	Reliable and good	I have bought a couple of hundred bottles of this over the last several months, and find it to be of good quality and highly consistent in texture and taste. It will dry out after a few minutes of exposure to air but so will your home made version. I've just entered an order for 60 bottles a month to get the reduced rate, and wish I'd done that sooner!	1	2
		A20VXYT5DL0ZC6	Delicious!	Puroast Low Acid Coffee has clear, bold flavor, no discernible acidity, quite delicious, and we really liked it. Highly recommended for people who need a low-acid coffee but want premium flavor.	0	0
		A12JKE0CYLRUCM	Love it!!	I love this tea. And it makes you feel very healthy, which is so needed during the Christmas and New Year season.. I haven't used it in one week, and I can soooo feel my body needing a good detox.  I recommend for anyone who has stomach issues, over indulges, and wants to feel generally better.	0	0
		A2S6ME3BHE6YJ5	Good on calories, bad on taste	Not recommended for those with taste buds.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because it's 0 calorie - so it has every right to taste awful.<br /><br />Would never buy again. Please god don't ever let me buy again.	0	0
		A3H4L7TJKQHW4Q	I love goat milk, but too bad....	Too bad this stuff in general ranks high on the inflammation triggering foods.  I'm trying to follow a low inflammation diet.  I do love the taste of goats milk.  It's very rich and creamy.  The liquid is better than the powder.	4	2
		ACJT8MUC0LRF0	Both my cat and I LOVE Natural Balance ... she is happy, healthy, and this food helps minimize the hairball activity!	Chances are if you are looking at Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance, you are looking into finding a quality cat food for you animals.  I'm a firm believer in buying the best quality foods for my animals in order to ensure their optimum good health, especially since the 2007 pet food recalls from melamine adulterated food.  Initially, when I purchased this food that didn't factor into my decision.<br /><br />I had a long-haired cat who gifted me with hairballs on a frequent basis.  A friend told me about this food and swore by it, claiming her rugs and furniture no longer suffered from constant scrubbing.  I decided to give Natural Balance a try and was amazed at the results.  I no longer have that cat, but did inherit another long-haired cutie pie who LOVES this food.  I changed her food to this one a month ago, gradually mixing it with her previous food, and it somehow helps her body minimize the hairball activity.  I want her to be healthy and happy and find the expense to be well worth it.  This is brief blurb from their website, information that can be found on the bag as well:<br /><br />*  Fresh Chicken, Salmon Meal, New Zealand Lamb Meal This unique blend of fresh, high quality proteins provides the essential amino acids to help maintain strong muscle tone and a healthy, shiny coat.<br /><br />*  Taurine Fortified To help maintain a healthy heart and good vision.<br /><br />*  Fresh Potatoes Rich in potassium and an excellent source of highly digestible carbohydrates.<br /><br />*  Preserved Naturally To maintain freshness, Natural Balance uses only mixed tocopherols (Vitamin E) in all of its formulas and will always be free of artificial flavors, colors and chemical preservatives.<br /><br />*  Skin and Coat Essential Fatty Acids are combined to produce an excellent skin and coat for your cat.<br /><br />*  High Digestibility<br /><br />No Artificial Preservatives, Flavors, Colors, or Bleached Ingredients.<br /><br />If you need to find out more, you can check out this food at Petco, where I purchased it, or head to the Natural Balance website.  Of course everyone has their own opinion and will look at several factors when purchasing for their animals.  You and only you know your needs, but I find that this food satisfies not only mine (I don't have to invest in so many paper towels), but obviously that of my cat.  I was using a perfectly acceptable organic food, but when I mixed this with it ... well, lets just say she likes Natural better than organic.  I'm happy if she's happy and I'm not constantly cleaning up after her these days!	16	0

		A2OOQ59V7YWYL1	Delicious	La Sabrozita Homestyle Tomatillo Salsa is simply delicious. I prefer green to red sauce and I've found one I really like. I've used it on tacos, burritos, and enchiladas, I've even mixed it with sour cream and used it for a dip. I can't understand why I can't get it here. I just hope Amazon continues to carry it.	0	0

		A17NAEWZDYCU7S	Sushi Making	Product arrived quickly with no problems.  Everything was intact and the kids were happy with the outcome.  The item produced fairly accurate looking sushi.  Did not eat the candies since there is too much handling and who knows what is in it?  However, it is fun to see the process.	3	0
		A2E2PA6UNK1E05	Two Paws Up!!	"I cannot really comment my own opinions on this product since for obvious reasons I will not be sampling it but I will trust the vendor that it is every bit as good for my cat as they say.  How would I know differently anyway?  All I can tell you is my cat's reaction.  This consisted of the following:<br /><br />""Meowwwww! Errowwww!"" (as I am dishing it out)  After placing it on the floor there was copious munching and slurping until the bowl was empty followed by licking of chops to devour anyy stray morsel that may have stuck to a whisker and then a forlorn look that indicated the preceding events should be repeated.  I'll take that as two paws up or whatever the feline equivalent is to the Siskel & Ebert sign of approval.<br /><br />None of this is any great surprise.  The noted finickiness of cats usually applies to dry food.  Place a bowl of any random dead animal parts in front of them and they are far more decisive.  Still, this was an especially energetic performance and hence the high rating."	0	2
		AAK2X378WNIU7	Most awesome tasting Energy Chews we have found!	We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!	0	0
